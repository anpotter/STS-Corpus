    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="preparation">Response to TRAWEEK </segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="39" relname="span">

First, I want to thank TRAWEEK for answering my question and my apologies</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="2" relname="elaboration">
if the question itself seemed unduly agonistic and freighted with
question-begging notions.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="5" relname="concession"> I will return to it shortly,</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="38" relname="span"> but first I want to
explain why I had misgivings about what you and some of the
anthropologists (I include here HEATH, STOCKDALE, EGLASH) were saying
about the STS-scientist interaction. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="59" relname="span">

It seemed to me that the tenor of your (plural) remarks was that the
entire question was being framed wrong,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="8" relname="means"> and that once we look at things
somewhat differently,</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="40" relname="span"> the question will dissolve:</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="40" relname="elaboration"> i.e., in some sense
there is NO problem with STS-scientist interaction.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="60" relname="span"> Given the sorts of
things that both STSers and scientists have been writing lately about
their interactions, </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="64" relname="span">I found the claim surprising and wanted to find out
more. </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">

I was then puzzled by some of the things I read:</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="66" relname="span"> For example, HEATH said
that scientists were &apos;sources&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="61" relname="span"> no mere objects of critique of both the
STSers&apos; and the scientists&apos; practices.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="62" relname="span"> I wondered what this meant in
practice,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="63" relname="span"> since it MAY mean that both STSers and scientists benefit from
the interaction,</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="42" relname="span"> but for different reasons</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="44" relname="span"> -- much like exchange relations
in capitalism, in which each trader has something that the other wants.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="20" relname="concession">
There is constructive interaction, in a sense,</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="43" relname="span"> but no one comes away
fundamentally changed.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="elaboration"> In fact, the traders are reinforced in their 
positions.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="23" relname="concession">

I can certainly believe that a physicist may improve her skills as a
physicist by listening to how an anthropologist talks about &apos;physicists in
action&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="49" relname="span"> but that may just reflect the tendency of some scientists to
regard social scientists as useful for reflecting on the &apos;public
relations&apos; side of what they&apos;re doing.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="45" relname="sequence"> So, I&apos;ve run across scientists who
actually court social scientists in order to help them make themselves
more presentable in various settings.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="46" relname="span"> Now, in return, the social scientist
might not mind being used in this fashion</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="25" relname="volitional-cause"> because it enables her to get
more material for her monograph, which, in turn, is intended largely to
contribute to the body of STS knowledge.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="47" relname="span"> In other words, the interests of
the scientist and the STSer never really intersect at a point of critical
engagement,</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="27" relname="circumstance"> where both sides are forced to recognize incompatibilities    
between the scientist&apos;s project and the STSer&apos;s project. </segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="54" relname="span">

Now, in her answer, TRAWEEK noted that physicists found her work useful in
understanding why students might not be picking up physics concepts in
class, and how that situation might be remedied.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="50" relname="concession"> I may be mistaken,</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="53" relname="span"> but
this strikes me as being in the spirit of exchange relations discussed
above.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="51" relname="sequence"> The physics teacher is always interested in improving teaching
practice,</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="51" relname="sequence"> and the anthropologist has something to offer her in that
regard.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="52" relname="concession"> There is nothing wrong with this sort of interaction, I suppose,</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="52" relname="span">
except that it seems to presume that the scientists are fine doing what 
they&apos;re doing,</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="34" relname="circumstance"> as long as they cooperate with the STSer in her research
assignment.</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="56" relname="span"> Is there NO place for critical engagement in this picture,</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="36" relname="concession"> or 
am I just not looking at things the right way?</segment>

&amp;gt; What we need now is more thoughtful discussion (and even

&amp;gt; accomplish -- something that goes beyond the mere
&amp;gt; understanding of science/scientists and considers the uses of
&amp;gt; such understanding -- and then about how we can and should try
&amp;gt; to attain whatever goals we have set for ourselves.  I do not

STS practitioners for the last twenty years have been developing various

In a world dominated by a rather simple-minded and falsifying view of

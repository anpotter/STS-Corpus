Response to HAKKEN, SCHMAUS, SOYLAND, and TRAWEEK</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="81" relname="span">

It seems to me that people here are working with different models for how 
the STS-scientist interaction should proceed, which in turn perhaps 
reflect different reasons why people in this field do the work they do. </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="62" relname="span">
However, before getting to that, let me start with SOYLAND&apos;s challenge.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="48" relname="preparation">

Question:</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="6" relname="condition"> If STS is a form of science criticism,</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="47" relname="span"> then why do we need to
try to influence scientists,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="47" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> since art critics don&apos;t influence artists? </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="preparation">

Answer: </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="60" relname="span"> Actually, there was a time when critics influenced artists,</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="56" relname="span"> and
historians influenced politicians</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="background"> (in fact some of the latter still
happens, if one is to believe political memoirs).</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="57" relname="span"> The rise of criticism as
something pursued largely for its own sake is a 20th century development,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration">
and not one that everyone has been pleased with.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="58" relname="span"> Basically, artists
started to ignore critics</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="55" relname="span"> when they found audiences who didn&apos;t need
critics to tell them what they should like.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="12" relname="span"> However, it&apos;s worth noting
that critics these days often see themselves as tutoring the tastes of
future audiences</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="antithesis"> rather than the skills of working novelists or painters.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="54" relname="span">
This is one reason why the debates over &apos;the canon&apos; are such a big deal.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="21" relname="volitional-cause">
People seem to think that critics-in-the-classroom actually make a big
impression on what students will consider good and bad art,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="52" relname="span"> and hence it&apos;s
important that the &apos;right&apos; works are being taught (from the &apos;right&apos; point
of view).</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="53" relname="span"> Maybe critics don&apos;t have influence even in that context,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="50" relname="condition"> but if
that&apos;s the case,</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="51" relname="span"> then there isn&apos;t much left for both sides of the
&apos;political correctness&apos; debates to argue about. </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="25" relname="background">


Now on to &apos;models&apos; of STS-scientists intereaction.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="80" relname="span"> I think HAKKEN, 
SCHMAUS, and TRAWEEK are working with three quite different conceptions. </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="27" relname="background">

SCHMAUS&apos;s is the clearest: </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="63" relname="span">STSer as applied ethicist for science or 
perhaps even public relations expert for science.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="68" relname="span"> My main problem with 
this view is that it&apos;s primarily &apos;reactive&apos;.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="64" relname="span"> In other words, the STSer 
really has nothing much to do until scientists get into trouble.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="29" relname="elaboration"> There 
may even be the presumption that the STSer would have to adopt the 
interests of the scientist rather than operate as an independent agent. </segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="32" relname="antithesis">
Much of applied ethics often seems to smack of the clientelism associated 
with the sophists in Ancient Athens. </segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="65" relname="span">It seems to me that this neglects 
the distinct perspective that STS brings to the study of science, which 
typically involves seeing discrepancies, disparities, silenced voices, 
etc. that have escaped the notice of the principal parties.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="65" relname="summary"> In other 
words, the STSer renders problematic what others may take as normal.</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="66" relname="evaluation"> It 
is much more &apos;proactive&apos; than SCHMAUS&apos;s model would seem to allow. </segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="73" relname="span">

And here I am probably in agreement with HAKKEN,</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="72" relname="span"> when he says that STSers
ought to cultivate marginalized scientists who, because of their
standpoints, may already be predisposed to STS-like positions.</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="38" relname="concession"> Already
there&apos;s a wide body of literature on the &apos;disunity of science&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="70" relname="span"> but this
would go one step further and show that any given science is itself
disunified, and perhaps -- in the case of physics -- a house divided
against itself.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="38" relname="elaboration"> In this context, many politically and intellectually
important questions are raised about the status of such notions as
&apos;disciplinary affiliation&apos; and &apos;professional identity&apos; in fields where 
there are clearly first, second, and third class members.</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="71" relname="span"> Here STSers 
can open up a dialogue within the scientific community, as well as with 
the larger society.</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="79" relname="span">

As for TRAWEEK, I am not clear what model of STS-scientist interaction
she&apos;s working with.</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="74" relname="span"> One way to relieve (at least my) unclarity would be to
hear why scientists would want to use your work in their courses, and why
they&apos;re interested in hearing you talk in the first place -- and whether
those reasons relate to why you&apos;d want them to use your work and to invite
you to speak.</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="77" relname="span"> In other words, do you detect a mutual interest or common
understanding in your interactions with the scientists? </segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="45" relname="concession">Of course, it is
possible for STSers and scientists to dwell in the same space, so to
speak,</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="75" relname="span"> but each get something quite different out of the exchange. </segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="75" relname="evaluation"> But I
would consider that a fairly minimal model of interaction.</segment>

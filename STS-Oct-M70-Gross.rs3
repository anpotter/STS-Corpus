  Ex: EDWARDS:</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="36" relname="list">
                               **********
  &quot;...Scientists&apos; self-understanding is not the whole story of
  science, but it plays an absolutely integral role, and
  abandoning &quot;actor categories&quot; altogether probably cannot
  produce a complete or coherent account of a cognitive
  activity.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="36" relname="list">
  
  &quot;...One thing STS does very well, which scientists usually do
  not do for themselves (or not very thoroughly), is to analyze
  the flows and transformations of power and information among
  science at the lab level, science at the institutional level,
  politics in various forms, and culture. As an adjunct to a
  scientific education, provocative but responsible STS courses
  could help scientists become more sophisticated about what
  becomes of their work. STS seminars/conversations/publications
  could have the same utility for practicing scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="36" relname="list">
  
  &quot;...A second, related interest of STS is to help make the
  ideological boundaries between science, politics, and culture
  more permeable.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="36" relname="list">
  
  &quot;...At a conference earlier this year I chided some of my
  colleagues for the tone of their discussion, which (as I
  experienced it) expressed deep disrespect for the work and
  thoughts of the scientists they study. The response was
  exactly what Bailar notes: &quot;they don&apos;t respect me, so why
  should I respect them? they get millions for equipment while I
  can&apos;t even find a job,&quot; etc. etc. Some practicing scientists
  attended this conference. I found it quite embarassing to have
  this kind of discussion happen in their presence. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="36" relname="list">
  
 &quot; ...We will get the respect of others when we deserve it, and
  that will come when we have things to say that make sense, are
  widely understandable, and serve significant practical
  purposes. I don&apos;t think my generation of STSers has reached
  that standard yet...

Indeed!  Provocative but RESPONSIBLE STS courses--and books, and
lectures--are badly needed in science (and all other) education,</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="8" relname="nonvolitional-cause">
because most scientists won&apos;t and can&apos;t study these issues for
themselves.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="9" relname="elaboration">  So are provocative and interesting science courses--
and books, and lectures--needed for the social sciences and
humanities, because most social scientists and humanists (and
ordinary, decent citizens) either can&apos;t or won&apos;t engage the inner
logic and the content of the science whose social correlates
(quite properly) excite them. </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> The tone Edwards refers to IS
pervasive;</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="52" relname="span"> most scientists, coming into contact with it for the
first time react to its hostility first with amusement, next with
amazement, and finally with anger.</segment>

In an earlier exchange on this list, some of our esteemed
colleagues said, in effect,</segment>

[scientists]! </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> They don&apos;t read our stuff,</segment>

    <segment id="22" parent="21" relname="evidence"> Lies about cold
fusion, Velikovsky, AIDS, cancer, the need for obstetricians,
solar neutrino fluxes--even about Newton, faker that he was, the

cosmological mass they talk about!&quot;</segment>

So long as a large part of the social and historical
criticism of science is unambiguously hostile, ignorant or
oblivious of understandings available to the most benighted,
scientists or not (e.g., that we know much more about the natural
world today than we did in 1580), wrong about all sorts of
elementary facts and issues of scientific content,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="50" relname="span"> working
scientists are not going to attend to the details of what is
said, except to become angrier. </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="47" relname="span"> For they, too, are threatened. </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="49" relname="span">
We all are:</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="48" relname="sequence"> it is a bad time for scholarship</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="48" relname="sequence"> and it&apos;s going to
get worse.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="53" relname="span">  The improvements that science desperately needs, such
as in teaching, in social awareness, and in regard for its own
foundational issues, are not going to be made</segment>

aggressive/defensive/political tone is at least diluted.</segment>

those old chestnuts, Objectivity and Knowledge of the Subject

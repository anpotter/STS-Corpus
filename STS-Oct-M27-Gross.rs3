    <segment id="1" parent="43" relname="background">Separating, as well as my limited skills allow, Andrew Weiss&apos;s
two points from their deeply felt embellishments, I make them as
follows:</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="31" relname="span">

1.   L &amp; G assert that with world population and travel as they
are, bad things would happen if, when the next pandemic strikes,
we didn&apos;t have organized sciences and technologies of e.g.,
pathology, public health, sanitary engineering.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="elaboration">  Weiss now
suggests that science is the CAUSE of overpopulation and world
travel, and asks, moreover, does science as it is also mean high-
energy physics, astronomy, &quot;science for the military,&quot; etc?</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="2" relname="elaboration">  He
reminds us also that we have a &quot;system of science&quot; in which women
and minorities are grossly underrepresented, etc, and that it&apos;s
not the (weakly) democratic, developed nations for which
population is a big problem, but the others. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="2" relname="elaboration"> Etc.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="27" relname="preparation">

Response: </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="27" relname="conjunction"> WHATEVER caused the rate of human population growth to
attain its current value, and made mass air transport possible,
we have both of them NOW.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="28" relname="span">  A third-world nation (with a deep
commitment to &quot;technoscience&quot; and thousands of intelligent people
doing it) has just--last week--turned to pathology, public
health, and sanitary engineering to stop in its tracks (it is
hoped!) a threatened pandemic of pneumonic plague.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="background">  It even made
the papers.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="11" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  The last major programs supporting only science Good
for the People, after WWII, and banning science Not Good for the
People, were in Stalin&apos;s Soviet Union and Mao&apos;s China.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="29" relname="span">  The
People didn&apos;t get much Good.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="35" relname="span">

2.   L &amp; G argue for a &quot;grudging and vigilant contract with
elitism,&quot; the meaning of which is made clear in the article. </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="elaboration">
&quot;But why,&quot; Weiss asks, &quot;must we take the scientists&apos; word when it
comes to deciding _what_ to study (as opposed to how)?...Are
scientists afraid of the people?&quot;

Response: </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="42" relname="span"> A grudging and vigilant contract with elitism is what
we have NOW. </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="36" relname="span"> Maybe Weiss thinks it should be MORE grudging and
vigilant.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="34" relname="span">  OK.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="33" relname="span">  No argument. </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="elaboration"> Maybe also more informed. </segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="39" relname="span"> The
distortion is to suggest that all politicians (who are supposed
to represent the public, after all) have signed a contract that
has NO vigilance or grudges. </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="evidence"> Anybody who believes that has not,
again, been reading the papers. </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="solutionhood"> Are scientists afraid of the
people?</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="38" relname="span">  No:</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="37" relname="span"> they ARE the people, or a part of it, as are
professors of STS. </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="23" relname="evaluation"> Why do not the latter apply for guidance on
_what_ to study? </segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="40" relname="span"> (Some) scientists (I hope) ARE afraid of
referenda on WHAT and HOW.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="25" relname="evidence">  Some are old enough to remember the
consternation and waste that followed, many years ago, the demand
from an influential Congressman, speaking, presumably, for his
constituents, that the NIH immediately deploy major resources in
an attack upon Athlete&apos;s Foot.</segment>

    <segment id="1" parent="19" relname="background">In his recent posting, Todd LaPorte argued for expanding STS
attention to the impacts and effects of science, presumably to complement, not
replace, the focus on generation of scientific knowledge.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="3" relname="concession">
 In general, I wish to
support his argument,</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="19" relname="span"> but I also wish to give it a different specific
articulation. </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="20" relname="span"> The focus he argues for should perhaps be described as a
focus on the reproduction of technoscience rather than effects/impacts. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="4" relname="interpretation">
The latter phrasing reinforces the technological determinist, linear models of
science production
and diffusion which STS has been at such pains to refute.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="21" relname="span">  We must be as open
to study of the effects of society on technoscience as technoscience on
society,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="elaboration"> and we must look at these in the same frame wherever possible. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="21" relname="evidence">
Knut Soerensen and Anne Jorunn Berg from Trondheim have been most
consistent among STS scholars in insisting on the way in which the
experience of technology-in-use changes the technology.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="22" relname="span">

Some of us do these kinds of studies consistently, with NSF support.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="9" relname="elaboration">  In
1986, Barbara
Andrews and I received a grant from the NSF anthropology program to study
the cultural correlates (another phraseology which avoids implicit
attribution of causation) of new information technology among working class
people in Sheffield, England. </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="23" relname="span"> In 1990, Burt Danovitz and I got a grant
from the NSF STS program to hold a conference on policy issues regarding
computer-based technology for people with disabilities.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">  This conference
addressed inter alia the policy problem of ways to include people with
disabilities in the production of these devices both as
scientists/engineers/technologists and as users/participants in the
development process.  </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="9" relname="elaboration">In 1993, Barbara Andrews and I again got an
anthropology NSF, this time to study the cultural construction of
computing at the national level in the Nordic countries. </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="condition"> 

If member of the STS network (rather than community) are unaware of such
research,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="25" relname="span"> it may have less to do with its non-existence than with the ways
in which we structure our collective attention (e.g., agendas for meetings).</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="29" relname="span">

One final note: the failure to maintain consistently a sufficiently
dialectical
framing of the relationship between technoscience and society (or
culture; socio-culture?) can also be immobilizing. </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="26" relname="span"> His conviction that the
consequences of new technology are so dire led David Noble, in his recent
closing plenary address to the participatory design conference, very close
to arguing that involvement in any design activity was for the time being
unethical. </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="evaluation"> So much for participatory democracy.</segment>

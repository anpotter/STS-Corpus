Patrick Hamlett&apos;s post and the responses are most welcome.</segment>

Yes, the attack is in part on the leftist scholars among the STSers.</segment>

it is more than that.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="56" relname="span"> I believe the people who lead  science are quite
frightened and rightly so.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> &quot;Scientists&quot; have been making false claims for
large amounts of money for decades and legislators and others are beginning
to ask question.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="12" relname="concession">

Steve Fuller&apos;s insightful comments about the intellectual issues are
fascinating and appear to be right on the mark.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="54" relname="span"> It is interesting but
not surprising that the conflict between scientists and STSers  is further
advanced in Britain than here in the US.</segment>

have the journalists who can understand notions of constructionism.</segment>

And we shouldn&apos;t be surprised that the debate gets stuck on the existence
of an external reality.</segment>

to all the layman learns for his or her whole life.</segment>

But at the root of the intense conflicts lies money.</segment>

The physicists in the US are still stung by the loss of the supercollider.</segment>

The journal SCIENCE in its recent issue on careers said that the chemistry

are traditional positions.</segment>

And so ---- all these abuses are present for all to see.</segment>

discourse.</segment>

    <segment id="2" parent="3" relname="nonvolitional-cause">

I&apos;m telnetting from Charlottesville, Virginia,</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="30" relname="span"> so this might be rougher 
to write...</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="22" relname="span">

Nobody is denying that philosophical considerations have informed and 
motivated scientific work.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="4" relname="elaboration"> In fact, it would be hard to comprehend the 
point of doing science without smuggling in philosophy.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="31" relname="span"> However, there 
are still a few open questions.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="23" relname="list"> First, whether scientists really need a 
class of people called &apos;philosophers of science&apos; to help them with their 
philosophizing.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="23" relname="list"> Second, whether philosophers of science should be in the 
business of &apos;helping scientists&apos; rather than doing something a bit more 
independent and/or critical. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="11" relname="antithesis">

The most interesting philosophers of science in this century were not
slavish worshippers of science,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="29" relname="span"> but in fact had conceptions of the
scientific enterpirse that went against the standing trends.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="concession"> I include
here not only Popper, Lakatos, and Feyerabend,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="5" relname="span"> but also the logical
positivists</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="circumstance"> -- since by the time those guys were writing,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="24" relname="span"> it was clear
already that you&apos;d have to do a major overhaul of scientific communication
patterns </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="condition">if you wanted to take the idea of &apos;unity of science&apos; seriuously. </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="circumstance">

When science studies people rail against philosophy of science,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="25" relname="span"> their 
target is usually the rhetoric that scientists use to discuss their 
activities in public -- appeals to truth, objectivity, rationality etc -- 
that wreak of philosophical origins,</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="26" relname="span"> but that don&apos;t seem to be needed to 
explain how science actually occurs.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="27" relname="span"> Consequently, the philosophical 
rhetoric appears to be a mystification, whcih ends up inflating 
everyone&apos;s expectations about what science can do -- something that is in 
no one&apos;s interest.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="28" relname="span"> From this standpoint, perhaps you can see why Latour 
and Collins, say, might think that they are doing science a favor by 
slaying the philosophical dragons.</segment>

&amp;gt; Fuller&apos;s comments about the write-in candidates for the Physical Society
&amp;gt; opens up an avenue that I think we need to explore more fully, the notion
&amp;gt; of constructing a dialogue with technoscience practitioners who share
&amp;gt; important elements of the STS perspective and are active in their own
&amp;gt; fields.  How can we help these individuals move beyond being what Hilary
&amp;gt; Rose has called &quot;shit shovelers&quot; (exposing &quot;bad practice&quot; in their fields)
&amp;gt; toward a more general discussion of the way forward?  Where can we meet
&amp;gt; them?  How can we get more of them to participate in our meetings, and us in
&amp;gt; theirs?  In my work in computing, the process of &quot;finding allies from the
&amp;gt; side of the practitioners&quot; is slow but progressing.  Can we move this
&amp;gt; outside of particular fields into a more general discourse?  The history
&amp;gt; of radical science movements, both that of the thirties (Bernal et. al.) and
&amp;gt; that of the sixties (e.g. science for people and science for the people)
&amp;gt; may have much to tell us on these questions.</segment>

    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="background">I can&apos;t resist adding a few cantankerous observations to the intriguing
discussion of STS &quot;under attack.&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="43" relname="span"> Re. the following:</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="42" relname="span"> 

&amp;gt;B. Lieberman to STSers -
&amp;gt;And we shouldn&apos;t be surprised that the debate gets stuck on the existence
&amp;gt;of an external reality. The notion that there is no such thing is counter
&amp;gt;to all the layman learns for his or her whole life.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="5" relname="preparation">

Looks like STSers will be filling new slots soon:</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="41" relname="span"> hi folks, we&apos;re the
reality experts.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="7" relname="solutionhood"> Guess what?</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="40" relname="span"> Everything you know is wrong.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="67" relname="span"> I think I&apos;ll
stick with the mere laymen in this regard, despite an awful lot of
training. </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="10" relname="condition">

If LIEBERMAN or anyone else genuinely believes that STS convincingly
demonstrates that external reality doesn&apos;t exist,</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="44" relname="span"> I would like to be
notified of just where and how this has been done.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="47" relname="span"> On my reading, most STS
literature asserts, and often demonstrates, some form of interpretive
flexibility in scientific claims or technological design.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="46" relname="span"> But there is a
vast difference between flexibility, an excellent metaphor whose
connotations should be taken seriously, and infinite malleability - which
doesn&apos;t even work as a metaphor (from what experiential background could it
be drawn?), much less as a coherent literal description of anything at all.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="45" relname="span">
The most common philosophical mistake in STS is to leap from the
possibility of _multiple_ interpretations or constructions to the
possibility of an _infinite_ number.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration"> When something flexes too far, it
breaks.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="49" relname="span">

Solipsism and full-on epistemological relativism are ancient and, in my
humble opinion, idiotic doctrines;</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="elaboration"> STS can claim neither to have invented
them nor to have proven them (proof, in any case, not being possible at all
within a consistent relativist frame).</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="50" relname="span"> If people in our community seriously
want to defend them,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="48" relname="span"> then I think we deserve the lambasting we&apos;ve been
getting.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="58" relname="span"> We should all, like Samuel Johnson, go kick some stones once in a
while.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="52" relname="span">

And unfortunately, contra the sensible folks who&apos;ve expressed amazement
that informed readers would find STS anti-science, I have often heard such
views expressed (privately) by various figures in our field.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="51" relname="span"> They say not
just that science is only one of many justifiable, useful, intelligible
ways of knowing (an important and perfectly defensible idea),</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="21" relname="evaluation"> but that it
is _worse_ (less truthful, less productive) than most, perhaps all, other
ways.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="56" relname="span"> This goes along, in the cases I&apos;m thinking of, with the extreme
relativism/solipsism mentioned above.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="25" relname="condition"> If people want references,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="54" relname="span"> I&apos;ll dig
them out,</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="55" relname="span"> but I think you know what I&apos;m talking about.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="59" relname="span">

I must say that like GROSS, I am impressed with the arrogance of this
position, which at least matches that of the scientists it criticizes.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="26" relname="background"> This
is the arrogance of the 19th-century anthropologist before his tribal
subjects and their childish, magical thought,</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="26" relname="evaluation"> and it deserves to be chased
from the stage wherever it appears. </segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="30" relname="background">

On another note, and more seriously, the discussion of COLLINS&apos; and others&apos;
appearance in the THES brings up a thought that&apos;s been nagging at me with
increasing frequency:</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="65" relname="span">

It&apos;s time a discussion of STS and its critics made its way into the New
York Review of Books.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="32" relname="concession"> I&apos;ve considered writing such a review myself,</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="64" relname="span"> but I
think others might be better positioned to do so.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="63" relname="span"> It&apos;s a daunting task,</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="61" relname="span">
since it would require choosing a few fairly recent, major works from the
many excellent candidates</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="60" relname="span"> (and the NYRB generally reviews only books
accessible to the educated lay public,</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="35" relname="nonvolitional-result"> so a lot of more technical/local STS
stuff wouldn&apos;t work).</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="33" relname="elaboration"> It would also require a reviewer willing to give the
Grosses and Leavitts of the world serious consideration, instead of the
rather self-righteous pooh-poohing in which many of us indulge on this net.</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="33" relname="elaboration">
Finally, it would require a reviewer able to get past the rather strict
gatekeepers at the NYRB.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="66" relname="span"> If anybody out there wants to take this on,</segment>
    <segment id="62" parent="39" relname="enablement"> I&apos;d be
happy to help think it through.</segment>

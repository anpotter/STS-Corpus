    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="preparation">To John Bailar, bravo.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="47" relname="span"> Far from being offended by his observations about
how scientists see STSers,</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="48" relname="span"> I think he has characterized a thorny problem
very nicely.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="84" relname="span"> 

In echoing his thoughts, I will simply reiterate a theme I&apos;ve expressed
before in this forum.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="82" relname="span"> Too much of current STS, especially but not
exclusively of the SSK variety, occupies an epistemological space which
exactly mirrors its scientific counterpart.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="49" relname="span"> That is, we (sociologists,
historians, whatever) try to look at scientists as people behaving in
unusual ways and saying/writing special things.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="52" relname="span"> We try to explain those
behaviors, including symbolic expression, without resorting to the
categories used by the scientists themselves.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="51" relname="span"> Put bluntly, they are bugs in
boxes to us</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="10" relname="condition"> - and if this is the sole perspective we adopt,</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="50" relname="span"> I for one am
not surprised they view us as arrogant and rather foolish.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="12" relname="condition">

Of course, if we really were behaving like good scientists,</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="53" relname="span"> then our
subjects should have no cause for complaint.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="53" relname="antithesis"> But we&apos;re not.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="concession"> Scientists who
study mind, brain, and behavior long ago abandoned the externalist (i.e.
behaviorist) approach of studying people without benefit of their
subjective reports of what is going on in their heads.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="58" relname="span"> But STSers often
act, and sometimes say, that their methodology must follow this outdated
and deeply disrespectful principle.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="concession"> Scientists&apos; self-understanding is not
the whole story of science,</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="57" relname="span"> but it plays an absolutely integral role,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="56" relname="span"> and
abandoning &quot;actor categories&quot; altogether probably cannot produce a complete
or coherent account of a cognitive activity.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="18" relname="background"> (See my article in the May
issue of Social Studies of Science for more on this.)</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="80" relname="span">

As for what STS is trying to do and whether it can/could make a difference
in the world comparable to that made by some (probably not most)
scientists, I have a few thoughts. </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="59" relname="list">

One thing STS does very well, which scientists usually do not do for
themselves (or not very thoroughly), is to analyze the flows and
transformations of power and information among science at the lab level,
science at the institutional level, politics in various forms, and culture.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="59" relname="list">
As an adjunct to a scientific education, provocative but responsible STS
courses could help scientists become more sophisticated about what becomes
of their work.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="59" relname="list"> STS seminars/conversations/publications could have the same
utility for practicing scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="81" relname="span">

A second, related interest of STS is to help make the ideological
boundaries between science, politics, and culture more permeable.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="26" relname="unless"> Unless
they are at the absolute pinnacle of their profession,</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="60" relname="span"> scientists who are
active politically (Steve Schneider, Paul Ehrlich, Terry Winograd) or
culturally (Carl Sagan, Carl Djerassi) must sacrifice a great deal of
respect from their fellows.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="61" relname="span"> Politicians (Al Gore) and cultural outlets
(newspaper science sections, science museums) often view science as a
pre-packaged commodity, something to be consumed rather than something they
can participate in, practice, criticize, and change.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="27" relname="elaboration"> My hope is that STS
could help generate more fluidity here, potentially affecting for the
better the apolitical, amoral, and ahistorical stance of so much scientific
education and practice.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="62" relname="span"> The discussion of how broad scientific research
priorities are set has largely left the public sphere,</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="29" relname="justify"> as Fuller and others
repeatedly point out.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="63" relname="span"> We might help to bring it back in.</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="33" relname="background">

At a conference earlier this year I chided some of my colleagues for the
tone of their discussion, which (as I experienced it) expressed deep
disrespect for the work and thoughts of the scientists they study.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="69" relname="span"> The
response was exactly what Bailar notes:</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="35" relname="condition"> &quot;they don&apos;t respect me,</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="67" relname="span"> so why
should I respect them? </segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="37" relname="antithesis">they get millions for equipment</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="64" relname="span"> while I can&apos;t even
find a job,&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="64" relname="elaboration"> etc.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="65" relname="elaboration"> etc.</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="41" relname="circumstance"> Some practicing scientists attended this conference.</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="68" relname="span">
I found it quite embarassing to have this kind of discussion happen in
their presence. </segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="76" relname="span">

We will get the respect of others</segment>
    <segment id="73" parent="42" relname="circumstance"> when we deserve it,</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="75" relname="span"> and that will come</segment>
    <segment id="72" parent="43" relname="circumstance">
when we have things to say that make sense, are widely understandable, and
serve significant practical purposes.</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="45" relname="antithesis"> I don&apos;t think my generation of STSers
has reached that standard yet,</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="77" relname="span"> but I think we can and will.</segment>

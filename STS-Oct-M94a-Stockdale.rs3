I
d like to add my voice to those of Sharon Traweek, Deborah
Heath and others who have been disturbed by the recent 
discussion on this list about the relation between science studies 
and science. </segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="13" relname="span">

The potential contribution of science studies lies in disrupting the 
simple categories and crude narratives we typically use to discuss 
science.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="elaboration"> Science consists of a rich tapestry of localized practices 
and discourses that is difficult or impossible to reduce.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="17" relname="span"> Our goal 
should be to restore a sense of this richness and diversity to our 
conversations and our conversations with others by involving 
ourselves in the web of relationships and practices that scientists 
are engaged in.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="11" relname="span"> The current polarized debate appears to be a 
retreat from this position.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="10" relname="span"> It has shifted back into an abstract 
discussion that is made possible by disengaging from the practice 
of science,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="concession"> although, ironically, the debate in part claims to be 
about having a practical effect. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="attribution">

Let me just quote Mike Lynch
s therapy: </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="15" relname="span"> &quot;Stop talking about 
science! Go to a laboratory - any laboratory will do - hang around 
for a while, listen to conversations, watch the technicians work, 
ask them to explain what they do, read their notes, observe what 
they say when they examine data, and watch how they move 
equipment around!&quot; (from Scientific Practice and Ordinary 
Action).</segment>

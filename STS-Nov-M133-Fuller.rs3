    <segment id="1" parent="90" relname="preparation">Relativism...and the Enlightenment: Response to MARKS et al.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="73" relname="span">

&apos;Relativism&apos; is a term that has outlived its usefulness in
science studies, and now does more harm than good -- especially
on the public relations front, but even when we try to explain
our research practices.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="6" relname="nonvolitional-result"> The term probably got used in the first
place</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="52" relname="span"> because science studies people were trying to
impress/attack philosophers,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="70" relname="span"> and so they assumed the mantle of
what they presumed the opposition to be.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="3" relname="circumstance"> Unfortunately, when most
people think of &apos;relativism&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="71" relname="span"> they still think of their
introductory philosophy class</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration"> where the view is presented as &apos;it
is so, if you say so&apos;.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="72" relname="span"> However, this view does little to explain
how science studies work, and in fact has led to an amazing
amount of mischaracterization of what this field is about. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="69" relname="span">

I agree with MARKS that what he calls &apos;methodological relativism&apos;
is a perfectly sensible research stance:</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="12" relname="antithesis"> Don&apos;t use truth to
explain an event</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="53" relname="span"> because &apos;truth&apos; is determined after the event
takes place.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="53" relname="background"> (This is why David Bloor originally called truth-
explanations &apos;teleological&apos;.)</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="concession"> Sometimes this is put in terms of
adopting the standpoint of the historical agents,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="56" relname="span"> but this can
be a bit misleading</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="55" relname="span"> because science studies practitioners rarely
take what the agents say at face value</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="elaboration"> (e.g. scientists are often
engaged in truth-talk).</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="19" relname="antithesis"> In that respect, &apos;methodological
relativism&apos; doesn&apos;t imply &apos;subjectivism&apos;.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="60" relname="span"> What &apos;adopting the
standpoint of the agents&apos; seems to involve is a realization that
the present can be made into a variety of futures, depending on
what the agents do.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="59" relname="span"> In philosophical terms, this is closer to a
kind of &apos;antirealism&apos; than &apos;relativism&apos;</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="condition"> -- if people still care
for such niceties.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="62" relname="span"> As LYNCH suggested, &apos;constructivism&apos; is still
a better name,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="64" relname="span"> at least it&apos;s one that resonates better with the
philosophical tradition.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="23" relname="elaboration"> (Note Bloor&apos;s entry into this whole
field via Wittgenstein&apos;s &apos;constructivist&apos; philosophy of
mathematics.)</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="67" relname="solutionhood">

Now MARKS also asks whether this &apos;methodological relativism&apos;
can/should be pushed further -- especially in a political
direction.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="27" relname="circumstance"> Like any philosophical position when it gets
politicized,</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="67" relname="span"> relativism is much more impressive in what it
opposes than in what it supports.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="29" relname="concession"> Although a certain &apos;politics
of relativism&apos; (associated more with anthropology than sociology)
has been important in breaking the stranglehold of Western forms
of &apos;universalism&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="66" relname="span"> left to its own devices relativist arguments
have been used to uphold all sorts of provinicialisms and even
racisms</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="65" relname="span"> (Have a look sometime at the legal justifications given
for Apartheid in South Africa:</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="30" relname="elaboration"> They are full of appeals to 
&apos;cultural autonomy&apos; that underwrite the creation of &apos;homelands&apos;,
as well as to the historical uniqueness of South Africa which
prevents it from being held accountable to &apos;Euorpean&apos; standards
of justice).</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="74" relname="span"> Here LYNCH is right on the money in being suspicious
about positive appeals to relativism,</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="32" relname="circumstance"> especially when they come
from people in power. </segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="80" relname="span">

However, I&apos;m not too worried about the scenario that TURTON
depicts about relativism leading to a Hobbesian state of nature
in science.</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="36" relname="condition"> After all, if everybody&apos;s motto became &apos;do only that
which you think will serve your interest&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="79" relname="span"> then it wouldn&apos;t be
long before you&apos;d be inventing Leviathans to monitor and regulate
the conflicting parties.</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="78" relname="span"> I take it that, in this respect, GUSTON
has answered TURTON. </segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="77" relname="span">The only reason why there isn&apos;t more
regulation of science is that people don&apos;t believe that TURTON&apos;s
scenario is true.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="40" relname="condition"> But if relativism in his sense should prevail,</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="76" relname="span">
you can be sure that the politicians and policymakers will soon
be there to &apos;bring order&apos;. </segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="88" relname="solutionhood">

But having said all that, I haven&apos;t answered MARKS&apos;s original
question about the &apos;Enlightenment Project&apos;.</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="43" relname="antithesis"> I wouldn&apos;t be doing
what I&apos;m doing</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="88" relname="span"> if I didn&apos;t still believe in the Project,</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="87" relname="span"> but it&apos;s
an uphill struggle.</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="46" relname="concession"> If I may regress to unfashionable
terminology,</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="85" relname="span"> I can give a brief explanation.</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="86" relname="span"> Postmodernists (and
I include science studies here) describe the world much more
accurately than the Habermasians, Popperians, and other Children
of the Enlightenment. </segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="83" relname="span">This is the central irony of our times,</segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="48" relname="background"> it
seems to me: </segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="82" relname="contrast">The people who promote Truth and Reason the most
also have the most fictional views of how the world works,</segment>
    <segment id="51" parent="82" relname="contrast"> while
the people who are in the best position to correct those views
don&apos;t believe that &apos;correction&apos; is an intelligible notion!</segment>

    <segment id="2" parent="31" relname="span">

&amp;gt;This book just appeared on my desk.  By Joyce Appleby (UCLA), Lynn Hunt
&amp;gt;(Pennsyvania), and Margaret Jacob (The New School), _Telling the Truth
&amp;gt;about History_ at first glance looks to be analogous to Gross and Levitt&apos;s
&amp;gt;_Higher Superstition_.  Three historians (like Gross and Levitt, two
&amp;gt;scientists) complain about how history (rather than science) is misused
&amp;gt;and misunderstood. The villains (and this I get from the blurbs on the
&amp;gt;book jackets) are (1) unscrupulous popularizers (Oliver Stone by
&amp;gt;implication), (2) &quot;critics who dissolve the author herself into one among
&amp;gt;many sources of meaning, reducing historical knowledge to a series of
&amp;gt;texts engaged with each other, not with the past,&quot; and (3) &quot;powerful
&amp;gt;constituencies [that] call for histories that affirm more than inform.&quot;
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;The key difference is that this critique of post-structuralist
&amp;gt;methodologies and abuses of the multiculturalist program seems not to
&amp;gt;descend into name calling and attacks on an &quot;academic left&quot; that really
&amp;gt;doesn&apos;t seem to exist (at least as Gross and Levitt portray it).</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="53" relname="span">


I heartily disagree,</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="33" relname="span"> and as an STSer and an avid constructionist generally,
I find Hunt, et al, excellent, probably the best allies we can have.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="32" relname="span"> Hunt
et al defend our flanks very nicely against attacks from the Gross and
Leavitt types</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="means"> precisely because they keep us from falling into the purely
idealist/relativist traps that lit-crit po-mos seem to.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="34" relname="span"> They view &quot;external
reality&quot; (for lack of a better term -- the use is mine alone, not Hunt&apos;s)
not as a necessary evil to which we must make concessions, but as an active
referent to keep our speculations well grounded.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="36" relname="span">

The position that Hunt et al take reminds me a bit of Rorty, in that they
recognize the validity of po-mo and constructivist criticisms, but worry
about the ability to say anything at all if we take those positions to
their logical extents.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="elaboration"> Not unlike Latour&apos;s notion of speed bumps (that
American can call them spped bumps, Brits can call them sleeping policemen,
but if you hit them too fast, regardless of what they&apos;re called, they&apos;ll
bang the hell out of your car), Hunt et al and Rorty&apos;s observations give us
practical ways to bring reality back in.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="41" relname="span">

We must remember that Hunt et al (and I) are historians,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="37" relname="span"> and we
professionally know that we&apos;d be stupid to deny that Pearl Harbor was
bombed on 7 Dec 1941, and criminal to deny that the Holocaust happened.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="38" relname="span">
Indeed, in conversations among historians over the past five years or so,
the latter issue has been one of considerable concern, especially given the
(shall we say) uncomfortable personal past of Paul de Man. </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="elaboration">Historians have
to make the distinction between &quot;facts out there&quot; and meanings and
interpretations.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="39" relname="span"> The approach of Hunt, et al also tries to come to terms
with, by the way, the methodologically and epistemologically conservative
orientation of the historical profession.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="43" relname="span"> As professional historians, those
of us on the leading edge (as I immodestly categorize myself) get far
better mileage out of setting prescriptions, constructions, and
representations against &quot;realities.&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="antithesis"> While some of our STS allies might
consider such an approach to be a sellout (in that it places historians
back in the center as arbiters of &quot;truth&quot; and believers in same),</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="42" relname="span"> it does
come to grips in some fashion with the idealism vs. realism/materialism
problem.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="51" relname="span">

Better still, our emerging use of a &quot;representations vs realities&quot;
framework is quite powerful in explaining the formation of popular
consciousness and ideology.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="18" relname="elaboration"> In my own work, I can set constructions of
housewifery, happy taylorized workers, and ideologies of progress,
promulgated by modernizers, against the grim realities I find in the
archives and set a nice dialectic into motion.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="18" relname="elaboration"> It gets us around weak
concepts like false consciousness and conspiracies, and allows us to
believe, when necessary, that most people in the past believed what they
were saying.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="46" relname="span"> Best of all, it allows us to comprehend what we all must
recognize if we are to be philosophically responsible:</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="45" relname="span"> that several
contradictory notions of truth can coexist and condradict each other</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="circumstance"> while
the world still remains coherent to those who hold apparently
internally-contradictory views.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="25" relname="concession">

I have to admit my initial rejection of Hunt et al, for many of the same
reasons Ed Morman cites.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="48" relname="span"> Nonetheless, placed in context, I believe the work
represents the necessary squaring off between
post-modernism/constructionism and materialism that all historians (if not
STSers) must pursue. </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="47" relname="span">The book represents a way to radicalize
traditionalists and to mainstream radicals so that a new synthesis can
begin to emerge.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="26" relname="elaboration"> In short, thus, I believe we need to view the work of
Hunt, et al, as an effort by some pretty solid allies.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="48" relname="background"> I concluded after
reading it that the jacket blurbs were there to lure obdurate mainstreamers
into new waters, not to confirm their prejudices.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="30" relname="background"> (A minor concession,
though, to Mormon:</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="49" relname="span"> the section on the Scientific Revolution, written I
assume by Jacob, is a bit on the pollyanna and positivist side for my
tastes).</segment>

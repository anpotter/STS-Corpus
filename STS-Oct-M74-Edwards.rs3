Bill Keith&apos;s comments are exceptionally perceptive.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="33" relname="span">

&amp;gt; Using an
&amp;gt;alternative vocabulary to redescribe a practice seems to automatically
&amp;gt;destablize it -- even if that was not part of the intention behind the
&amp;gt;redescription!  So, if we use social, economic or rhetorical vocabularies
&amp;gt;to redescribe science, no matter how great our respect and good
&amp;gt;intentions, the effect, for participants and observers, is that an
&amp;gt;effective redescription destablizes science as a genuine practice. </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="43" relname="span">

I think the issue is in fact even more complicated than this.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="34" relname="span"> Some people -
primarily scientists and ex-scientists who&apos;ve gone into the recent-history
biz - seem able to redescribe events in terms of lab and institutional
politics without offending most of their colleagues.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="4" relname="evidence"> (I&apos;m thinking of e.g._
The Double Helix_, Herbert York&apos;s _Making Weapons, Talking Peace_, or Steve
Schneider&apos;s _Global Warming_.) </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="42" relname="span"> So not only the redescription, but the
relative authorization of its source as an insider/outsider, enters into
whether or not a redescription destabilizes. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="8" relname="background">

It&apos;s outsider redescriptions that are _viewed as_ destabilizing.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="35" relname="span"> The odd
thing is that neither scientists nor their funding agencies usually pay
much attention to these.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="36" relname="span"> So are they really destabilizing (of actual
practice)?</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="41" relname="span"> Or is this an idealization? </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="37" relname="span">

I tend to think it&apos;s the latter</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="39" relname="span"> - STS, as Weiss and others correctly point
out, is hardly the huge, well-funded, well-organized attack on science that
Gross et al. seem to see.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="14" relname="condition"> If Gross is right (as per his recent reply to my
comments) that no anti-realist conjecture has ever had any impact on
standard views of objectivity and knowledge in scientific practice, </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="38" relname="span">then I
don&apos;t see why the redescriptions of a few more sociologists and historians
will matter much. </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="40" relname="span">

I would guess that _sufficiently critical_ insider redescriptions, e.g.
Joseph Weizenbaum&apos;s _Computer Power and Human Reason_ or Winograd&apos;s
_Understanding Computers and Cognition_,  have more of an effect on
scientific practice than any number of Thomas Kuhns or Harry Collins.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="elaboration"> Even
here, immediate ostracism is the more common effect of serious challenges
to dominant views, especially from a humanities/historical/linguistic
perspective.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="56" relname="background">

&amp;gt; In general nobody, I
&amp;gt;think, likes to be redescribed, either as a product of Freudian forces, or
&amp;gt;a carrier for genes, or as a wetware computational device -- what&apos;s at
&amp;gt;issue here?   Thoughts?  </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="56" relname="span">

I wrote in previous comments that scientists&apos; self-understanding is
integral to, but not exhaustive of, a comprehensive analysis of science.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="45" relname="span"> As
in politics, in science inherent tensions between people&apos;s &quot;objective&quot; and
&quot;subjective&quot; positions (both terms used under erasure) helps drive the
machine.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="44" relname="span"> Gilbert and Mulkay&apos;s _Opening Pandora&apos;s Box_ is brilliant on this
point:</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="elaboration"> scientists themselves have alternate descriptions of their work as
an intellectual and as a socio-political project, whose production depends
upon the context and purposes of description. </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="50" relname="span">

The climate scientists I study are alternately </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="48" relname="list">intellectuals working on
issues about radiative transfer, etc.;</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="48" relname="list"> participants in the major political
project of creating social responses to climate change;</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="48" relname="list"> and
institution-builders competing for resources and support.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="51" relname="span"> These various
descriptions (of which many are well aware) don&apos;t mesh all that well,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="49" relname="span"> but
human affairs are like that.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="55" relname="span"> I think what needs explaining is more the
expectation that descriptions at different levels will be compatible (an
effect of scientific worldviews?)</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="26" relname="antithesis"> than the fact that they aren&apos;t.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="52" relname="span">

&amp;gt;Edwards wants science to be permeable and accountable (and so do I) but do
&amp;gt;accomplish this, he&apos;s going to have to invoke a redescription of science
&amp;gt;and scientific practice which will make Gross uncomfortable, no matter how
&amp;gt;much he appreciates Edwards&apos; respect and goodwill.  In addition, Gross
&amp;gt;seems to take any redescription as a sort of &quot;net translation loss,&quot; where
&amp;gt;the acheivements of Science since 1580 disappear in a haze of STS talk. </segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="28" relname="evaluation">

Right on.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="53" relname="span"> What I&apos;m looking for are thick descriptions that don&apos;t depend on
debunking strategies,</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="30" relname="elaboration"> but really face the complexities of what Peter Taylor
is calling &quot;heterogeneous construction.&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="53" relname="elaboration"> I think it&apos;s possible, and
necessary, to do this without casting science or scientists as idiots,
cultural dopes, or villains.</segment>

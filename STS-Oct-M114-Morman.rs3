    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="background">This book just appeared on my desk.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="8" relname="span">  By Joyce Appleby (UCLA), Lynn Hunt
(Pennsyvania), and Margaret Jacob (The New School), _Telling the Truth
about History_ at first glance looks to be analogous to Gross and Levitt&apos;s
_Higher Superstition_. </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="elaboration"> Three historians (like Gross and Levitt, two
scientists) complain about how history (rather than science) is misused
and misunderstood.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="2" relname="elaboration"> The villains (and this I get from the blurbs on the
book jackets) are (1) unscrupulous popularizers (Oliver Stone by
implication), (2) &quot;critics who dissolve the author herself into one among
many sources of meaning, reducing historical knowledge to a series of
texts engaged with each other, not with the past,&quot; and (3) &quot;powerful
constituencies [that] call for histories that affirm more than inform.&quot; </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="2" relname="elaboration">

The key difference is that this critique of post-structuralist 
methodologies and abuses of the multiculturalist program seems not to 
descend into name calling and attacks on an &quot;academic left&quot; that really 
doesn&apos;t seem to exist (at least as Gross and Levitt portray it).</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="9" relname="span">

I hope others on this list take a look at this book, and have 
something to say about it on this list. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="elaboration"> Look especially at
its discussion of how the establishment of science as a model for 
gaining objective truth influenced the development of the historical 
enterprise beginning in the eighteenth century.</segment>

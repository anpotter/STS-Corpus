    <segment id="1" parent="48" relname="span">It seems to me that many readers of (or at least writers to) 
this list are looking at the &quot;backlash&quot; as predictable 
defensivesess of what scientists see as their territory:</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="3" relname="volitional-cause">  
Those STSers are after me and my work,</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="28" relname="span"> so let&apos;s go get &apos;em!</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="49" relname="span">

If that is our response,</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="29" relname="span"> we may harm STS. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="31" relname="span"> Do not
underestimate the sincerity, the passion, or the power of
others</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="6" relname="antithesis"> just because you disagree with them. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="32" relname="span"> And do not dismiss
the whole package</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="7" relname="antithesis"> just because you have some special background
and technical knowledge and can tell that parts of it are
flawed.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="11" relname="condition">  If we don&apos;t develop some answers that are convincing
(to those who need to be convinced, which is not nesessarily to
ourselves)</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="33" relname="span"> we may lose a lot, including academic departments, 
students, money, respect, and influence.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="50" relname="span">

Which brings me back (yes, still another time) to the
question,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="39" relname="span"> What are we really trying to accomplish?</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="36" relname="span">  A couple of
answers have said or implied that we all have our own quite
different concerns</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="14" relname="nonvolitional-result"> so there can&apos;t be any common thread,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="37" relname="span"> but
that doesn&apos;t get us anywhere. </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="38" relname="span"> Surely STS as a whole should
have more coherence than would be evident in the collection of
individual interests. </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="evidence"> (Would anyone say that chemistry, for
example, lacks underlying structures and goals because one
chemist is interested in the combustion products of gasoline,
and another in the arrangement in space of the atoms in some
plastic, and still another in more efficient extraction of
copper from ore?)</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="47" relname="span">

Is is possible, and even thinkable and discussable, that the
critics may have some valid points? </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="21" relname="concession"> Certainly, they have
convinced a lot of people,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="44" relname="span"> and, whether they are right or
wrong, our whining and moaning will not do much for us.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="45" relname="span">  Nor
can we go back to where we were some years ago, in quiet
obscurity. </segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="43" relname="span"> The cat (i.e., STS) is out of the bag.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="27" relname="volitional-cause">  Because of
the critics,</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="41" relname="span"> a lot of people have become aware that we exist</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="42" relname="span">
and that maybe they should pay STS some attention, not
necessarily favorable.</segment>

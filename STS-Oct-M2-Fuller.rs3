It looks like the inevitable clash between scientists and STSers is 
beginning to happen in earnest.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="24" relname="span"> Over here in the UK, Harry Collins&apos; 
stubbly face takes up half of the frontpage of the most recent Times 
Higher Education Supplement. </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="26" relname="span">Inside are three pages of sociologists and 
scientists facing off against each other.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="27" relname="span"> (Mostly scientists are 
represented,</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="concession"> though not all are unsympathetic to STS-style claims.)</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="29" relname="span"> The 
THES has been quite good about covering STS stuff generally.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="28" relname="span"> For example, 
they periodically feature editorials that chastise scientists for not 
taking the trouble to publicly justify their activities. </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="elaboration">STS is portrayed 
as a symptom of scientists&apos; increasing insularity.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="2" relname="evidence">

The most recent cause celebre in this dispute is Harry Collins&apos; refusing to
share the podium with arch-STS-basher, biologist Lewis Wolpert, at the
British Association for the Advancement of Science meetings, and then
being harangued by Wolpert for desecrating science in various ways. </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="48" relname="span">

We&apos;re planning a conference in Durham for early December to bring the 
various parties together -- and to include some middle-of-the-road types 
(historians and philosophers) whose voices have not been heard so far.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="35" relname="background">

Just from looking at how this has played out in the media so far, it 
seems to me that STSers are inclined to send out two different messages:</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="31" relname="conjunction">

(1) STSers just want to be left alone to study science-in-action,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="condition"> and if 
scientists want to challenge STS claims,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="32" relname="span"> they should study up on the 
subject first.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="34" relname="conjunction"> It&apos;s a kind of academic freedom defense,</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="34" relname="conjunction"> and Collins makes 
the appeal quite openly. </segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="36" relname="span">

(2) STSers want to open up &apos;public understanding of science&apos; to include, not 
merely appreciative gazes (a la most science popularization), but also 
discussions about the kinds of scientific research that should be 
supported.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="33" relname="solutionhood"> This is the kind of democratizing move that I personally prefer.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="49" relname="concession">

Although (1) and (2) have common foes,</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="49" relname="span"> you will notice that they pull in
two different directions</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="38" relname="elaboration"> -- one toward expertism (i.e. STS is itself an
expertise) and the other toward anti-expertism.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="22" relname="antithesis"> Nobody involved in the
public side of this debate has remarked on the tension between the two
positions,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="39" relname="span"> but I imagine it will become more prominent as &apos;STS&apos; starts to
represent something in the public&apos;s eye.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="50" relname="span"> For the moment, however, it&apos;s
been my experience that both journalists and scientists are fixated on the
possibility that constructivist STS denies the existence of an external
reality -- and how one could say such absurd (but dangerous!) things. </segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="23" relname="background">
People seem to have a hard time getting beyond worrying about this issue,
which leads me to think that there is indeed something almost &apos;sacred&apos; 
about people&apos;s allegiances to science.</segment>

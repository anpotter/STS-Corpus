   ---------------
   As far as I am concerned, the &quot;reflexivity problem&quot; is a non problem
   (beyond a certain point, e.g., beyond one level of reflexion),
   and the more we dwell on it, by that much we are wasting time.  It&apos;s
   a very nice academic question, but a question that I think has been
   inflated too much.  It is time we let that big balloon float away.

   Well, BOUZID, taking it at ONE level of relexion and not dwelling on 
   it...  I still ask:</segment>

   ----------------
   Also, FULLER seems to be concerned a bit by the question of &quot;expert&quot;....
   It&apos;s not the notion of &quot;expert&quot; that should bother
   us, per se, but the notion that the expert has control and
   TAKES THE INITIATIVE to define what is a problem, how to solve
   it, and what counts as a solution.  That experts are allowed
   to do that is what should bother us.  In a more democratic
   society, the expert still has his/her role to play: but,
   the way I see it, this expert would not be the one taking the
   initiative, but would be, as it were, at the service ofthe larger 
   populace.

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;
Now, of course, we see the scientific community awakening to what&apos;s 
been going on in STS for the past 15 years, and that community -- or 
at least some noted spokespersons -- is clearly frightened and 
panicked by the STS literature. I suppose after long neglest, it&apos;s 
nice to be noticed, at all. However, I fear that the barrage of 
criticisms will overwhelm the theoretical insights that STS has to 
offer to  newly aroused scientists. The contributions of our field 
will get lumped with other suspect intellectual movements, and we may 
find ourselves defensively responding to the scorn of scientists who, 
themselves, have not examined the STS literature, but have followed 
the lead of the few scientists who have published attacks. I 
certainly think these developments will make even more difficult
various efforts to build STS programs on campuses.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="29" relname="span">


It really all depends on how WE (&quot;the STS community&quot;) decide
to react. </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="30" relname="span"> If we decide to take seriously such rabid and blind 
criticism of STS work as the one fully illustrated in Gross &amp; Levitt&apos;s 
work (_Higher Superstition_),</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="31" relname="span"> then we are pretty much setting 
ourselves up and letting our detractors decide our agenda for
us. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="27" relname="span"> For one thing, these people have absolutely no interest
whatsover getting involved in any sort of constructive exchange
with us. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="20" relname="span"> Their intentions are as transparent as their aversion
for us:</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="22" relname="span"> they want to dispense with us as fast as possible and
with the minimum amount of effort it takes them to reach
their goals. </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="21" relname="span"> So, reacting to them by developing an argument
would be foolhardy, not to say pathetic.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="9" relname="evidence">  Enough work has been
done already for anyone who is operating in good faith.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="23" relname="span"> Second, many 
of our detractors are not really worried about us influencing
the scientists--</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="volitional-cause">they think we will simply not be able to do that--</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="24" relname="span">
but rather, they think we will have a bad effect on the policy
makers. </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="25" relname="span"> So, by becoming overly preoccupied with their &quot;beefs&quot;,
we would be distracting ourselves from a genuine avenue, 
instead having our collective head turn in the direction THEY want us
to turn it.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="span">  For instance, we can go a long, long way tapping into
the population of malcontents among the scientists</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="16" relname="elaboration">--those
who have suffered and are still suffering from status quo
science funding, for example. </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="32" relname="span"> The trick is to present our 
message to these scientists in such a way that the false
impression given that we are anti-science is avoided. </segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="17" relname="elaboration"> And
what&apos;s more, may have a head start on this given that these
detractors of ours still equate the scientific community
with that select set of Nobel laureates and the upper thin
layer of elite scientists.</segment>

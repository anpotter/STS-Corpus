    <segment id="1" parent="29" relname="span">On Fri, 28 Oct 1994, Dr. Joseph R. Herkert drew attention to my comment on
constructing a dialogue with technoscience practitioners who share 
important elements of the STS perspective and are active in their own
fields.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="26" relname="sequence">  I wondered about how can we help these individuals move beyond being
what Hilary
Rose has called &quot;shit shovelers&quot; (exposing &quot;bad practice&quot; in their fields) toward a more general discussion of the way forward? </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="26" relname="sequence"> 

Heckert responded by suggesting participation in section on the social
implications of technology (SSIT) of the IEEE as one place where such a
dialogue can take place.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="27" relname="background"> He then went for the neat rhetorical phrase: </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="28" relname="span">
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; So grab a shovel and join us! </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="48" relname="span">

I would like to use Heckert&apos;s intervention as an occasion to comment on
the discourse which took place in the sci-tech-studies cyberspace</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="circumstance"> while I
was off talking with technoscientists at the Participatory Design
Conference. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="42" relname="span"> Much of this discussion has been over what are the
appropriate modalities for discussion between STSers and technoscientists,</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="31" relname="span">
and in outlining their various positions on this issues, participants
have also been more indirectly than directly identifying their position on
Bailer&apos;s query--</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="8" relname="elaboration">why do we do this? </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="elaboration"> What&apos;s it for?</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="45" relname="span">

In my case, I was arguing for a discourse with technoscientists to address
a specific current conjunction, a backlash against STS by some natural
scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="32" relname="span">  My idea was that the STS enterprise, whatever the motivations
or preferred modalities of its participants, was vulnerable to this
backlash as long as we failed to project commitment to discussion of how
we would reconstruct scientific practice in light of our critique of its
current forms. </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="elaboration"> &quot;Beyond shit shoveling&quot; was my way of labeling an aspect
of this discussion which I feel is necessary, one in which STSers find
ways to engage technoscientists in a discussion over both specific
technoscience practices but also the general nature of the technoscience
enterprise.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="circumstance">

While the comments on the net have been fascinating,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="33" relname="span"> I feel many of them
have been abstracted from this specific conjunction,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="49" relname="span"> so I thought I&apos;d try
one more time to state the issue as I see it:</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="38" relname="span"> How do we respond to the
backlash,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="elaboration"> and should a substantial part of this response be a discourse
with interested technoscientists over what a technoscience practice
informed by STS critique would look like?</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="39" relname="span">  Further, are there ways that we
should be moving corporately (as groups) to construct this specific discourse?</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="37" relname="span">

I am aware that this more activist posture may be uncomfortable both for
some of my anthropological colleagues and for some technoscientists.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="35" relname="span">  In
the Participatory Design community, for example, there are technologists
who are suspicious of the attempts of anthropologists to move beyond
trying to understand information system development to becoming involved
in the system development process itself,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="21" relname="elaboration"> just as there are
anthropologists who would feel compromised were they to become too heavily
involved in practice. </segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="36" relname="contrast"> At the same time, I have talked to systems
developers who are angry about the anthropologists&apos; hesitation to &quot;get
their hands dirty&quot; and take some responsibility for the character of the
systems which get constructed.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="41" relname="span">

My argument is that the current conjunction should shift the ground of
this discussion toward more intense engagement, both in practice and in
theory. </segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="24" relname="elaboration"> I really do mean something more than shit shoveling.</segment>

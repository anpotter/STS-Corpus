    <segment id="2" parent="1" relname="elaboration">

On getting science studies into the New York Review of Books:</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="34" relname="span"> In
principle, it&apos;s a great idea,</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="50" relname="span"> but I wonder just how receptive NYRB is to
science studies.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="4" relname="evidence"> Didn&apos;t Clifford Geertz do a number on Donna Haraway and
some other feminist writers a few years ago?</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="48" relname="span"> Also, does anyone know of a 
case where they accepted a review that hadn&apos;t first commissioned?</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="elaboration"> The 
same people always seem to crop up as reviewers. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="concession">

However, assuming these are not insurmountable barriers,</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="36" relname="span"> the question
becomes who does the review.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="35" relname="span"> I doubt if a high-profile person in this
field would actually be allowed to do the review.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="elaboration"> Either they&apos;d pick a
well-placed scientist (like GROSS) or someone who is professionally
disposed to be detached and neutral, like a historian.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="47" relname="span"> A good person for
the latter role would be David Hollinger, this year&apos;s HSS banquet speaker,
whose own work is in contemporary intellectual history.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="elaboration"> He identifies
himself as a Rortyan pragmatist, which means that he is sympathetic with
all but the more radical fringes of STS.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="37" relname="span"> At the same time, he was able to
write a polite review of Gerald Holton&apos;s latest effort, _Science and
anti-science_, which contains some of the NAS-ish stuff that HAMLETT
started us off with.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="14" relname="background"> This appeared in _Science_. </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="preparation">

On that lunatic fringe in STS:</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="46" relname="span"> Actually, I&apos;d like to see some names 
named.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="elaboration"> Who is on record as saying that there is no external reality and 
that science is overall worse than other forms of knowledge?</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="38" relname="span"> What people 
DO say is that the question of external reality is irrelevant to 
understanding what scientists do and why they do it.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="39" relname="span"> This is quite a 
different claim, and should be thought of in the same light as trying to 
explain religion without making reference to a deity.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="background"> One need not be an 
atheist to think this a worthwhile project.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="23" relname="concession"> Now, I will grant that some 
people attached to the political movement side of feminism, ecology, and 
multiculturalism often sound anti-science,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="45" relname="span"> but I think we need to go 
beyond the injudicious soundbite to get at what bothers them.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="25" relname="circumstance"> As we get 
closer to the &apos;academic&apos; side of our field,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="43" relname="span"> more hostility is vented 
toward philosophers than scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="40" relname="span"> Latour, e.g., once described 
philosophers of science as &apos;the strumpets and whores of science&apos; </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="26" relname="background">
(something like this appears in the interview he did with Werner 
Callebaut in _Taking the Naturalistic Turn_).</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="29" relname="circumstance"> And when scientists are 
harangued,</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="44" relname="span"> it&apos;s usually because they&apos;ve bought into some philosophical 
theory of science that leads them to capitalize their references to &apos;truth&apos;. </segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="41" relname="span">
For example, I&apos;ve never read anything by Harry Collins that was 
anti-science.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="42" relname="span"> In fact, in his piece for the THES, he actually goes out of 
his way to say how much he likes science and how he&apos;s trying to get 
people to relate to it better</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="31" relname="background"> (The piece is written as a long 
advertisement for _The Golem_, recently released in paperback.)</segment>

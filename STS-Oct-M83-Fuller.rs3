[Scientists] will need to see some reason to become engaged.
&amp;gt; And this brings me back to my original question, restated a few
&amp;gt; weeks ago here, about the ultimate purposes of our work (as
&amp;gt; well as theirs).  Can we help them produce a strain of rice
&amp;gt; with a higher yield, or come up with the Grand Unified Theory
&amp;gt; of physics, or reduce human suffering from cancer, or anything
&amp;gt; else they may care about?  Conversely, can we show that their
&amp;gt; talents would be better invested in some other approach to the
&amp;gt; elucidation of natural phenomena, or that their meritocratic 
&amp;gt; approach to the big decisions of science is sub- optimal in
&amp;gt; some way not yet defined, or that society would be better
&amp;gt; served if science were harnessed more directly to political
&amp;gt; objectives?  </segment>

I&apos;ll just deal with the examples mentioned. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="33" relname="span">

In the case of new strain of rice, the STSer would want to back up and ask
what is the problem for which the new strain is proposed as a solution.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration">
Scientists very often treat problems as targets to be shot at with
custom-made &apos;magic bullets&apos;.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="34" relname="span"> However, in the case of famine relief, the
real problem often isn&apos;t a lack of food or green thumbs,</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="32" relname="span"> but the
distribution channels that make it impossible for people to get the food
that is already available.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="32" relname="antithesis">  Continued investment in scientific research in
this context might divert resources that might be better spent addressing
problems of the local political economy. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="38" relname="span">

In the case of the Grand Unified Theory, the STSer might be able to help
the more hubris-ridden proponents of such a thing -- e.g. Steven Weinberg
-- to get a better grip on the exact significance of such a project,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="elaboration">
specifically what difference would it make to scientists in other fields
if physicists came up with GUT. </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="antithesis"> Weinberg et al. make it sound as though
all of science hangs with bated breath for the arrival of GUT,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="39" relname="span"> when in
fact this is sheer nonsense based on a vulgarized form of physical
reductionism.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="condition"> Of course, if ONLY STSers saw that it was nonsense,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="36" relname="span"> then we
would be accused of calling the GUT-mongers names.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="42" relname="span"> However, scientists in
other fields, and within physics itself, have already objected to the
self-serving rhetoric of GUT.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="concession"> Although he fails any relevant STS 
literture,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="41" relname="span"> David Lindley&apos;s _The End of Physics_ is actually a good step 
in the right direction here. </segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="45" relname="span">

In the case of reducing human suffering from cancer, some of the above
remarks about &apos;magic bullets&apos; apply here as well.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="43" relname="span"> Also, much of the
grandiose rhetoric about fighting a &apos;war on cancer&apos; has backfired on the
scientific community,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="antithesis"> even though it licensed vast amounts of government
money in the early days.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="46" relname="span"> Once again, STSers could point out the value of a
tempered rhetoric to prevent manic-depressive public responses.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="44" relname="span"> In
addition, there may be something to be said for STSers destabilizing the
idea that life is worth preserving at any cost, including endless
suffering from treatments that merely retard the advance of cancer.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="23" relname="elaboration"> Here
some anthropology of medicine -- and indeed some history of our own
culture from before the hegemony of scientific medicine -- would offer
alternative models for dealing with matters of life-and-death. </segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="50" relname="span">

As my last remarks suggest, one thing STSers can do generally is to
juxtapose examples from practices in our own cultural past or from that of
other cultures to show that things have been -- and can be -- done
differently. </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="47" relname="span"> This applies no less to the science policy apparatus itself,
which -- as was pointed out by several of us a few weeks ago -- is a
relatively recent invention.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="49" relname="span"> Showing how the &apos;peer review vs. pork&apos;
distinction got constructed in the first place can be very illuminating in
helping us now construct alternative courses of action.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="29" relname="antithesis"> Scientists are
professionally trained to have historical amnesia with regard to such
sacred matters as the social construction of merit,</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="48" relname="span"> and here STSers can
refresh their memories.</segment>

On September 7th 1994, at the annual meeting of the British Association
for the Advancement of Science, I found myself on the same platform as
Lewis Wolpert.  Our debate - about the relationship between science, and
the sociology of science - was extraor indarily heated.  The sociology and
history of scientific knowledge - `SSK&apos; as it has become known - as well
as being the subject of the argument can help to explain what was going
on. 
        SSK has been going for a quarter of a century.  It has shown that
the results of scientific experiments are more ambiguous than they are
usually taken to be, while theory is more flexible than most people
imagine.  This means that science can progress on ly within communities
that can reach consensus about what counts as plausible.  Plausibility is
a matter of social context so science is `a social construct&apos;.  Some
scientists feel uncomfortable with this idea though those involved in
scientific controver sy nearly always find it reflects their experience.
        SSK has been ignored by natural scientists for most of its 25
years, but is now coming in for some attention - most positive, some
negative and some vicious.  This may be because many scientists are less
certain of their role than they were just a few ye ars ago.  Science can
no longer has unquestioned authority.  I suspect that attacks on SSK as
violent as that of Wolpert - a Fellow of the Royal Society and the Chair
of the Council for Public Understanding of Science (COPUS) - have
something to do with t he new insecurity. 
        One methodological precept of SSK is `relativism&apos;.  Relativism
makes people excited.  On the face of it, relativism was the focus of the
Loughborough debate.  Let me explain it.  Every practitioner of SSK agrees
that to understand the course of a scienti fic controversy one must adopt
the perspective of the scientists involved.  These scientists did not know
the outcome of their collective work in advance, they were each trying to
bring about a certain outcome.  Therefore one must not take the outcome of
the controversy into account in investigating its course.  In other words,
one must act as though the outcome of a controversy (a new fact about the
natural world), was not a cause of the scientists&apos; beliefs.  A brief
example from the book I co-wrote with Trevor Pinch, The Golem, shows how
relativism works in practice. Nowadays, the Michelson-Morley experiment of
1887 is said to have `proved&apos; the special theory of relativity (1905) by
showing that light travels at the same speed in all directions. 
        Knowing this directs our attention away from the following: (i)
Michelson was never satisfied with the experiment; (ii) until 1924 the
experiment was never done according to the protocal set down by Michelson
himself; (iii) in 1924, Miller, one of Michel son&apos;s collaborators,
repeated the experiment according to the full protocol and discovered a
variation in the speed of light of 10 kilometres per second; (iv) in 1925
the American Association for the Advancement of Science awarded Miller its
physics prize
 for the finding; and (v) the experimental problem was still unresolved up
to at least the 1950s. 
        Thus, contrary to the way the story is usually told, there was no
agreed direct experimental proof of the constancy of the speed of light
for more than half a century after the official `proof&apos;.  That the speed
of light is constant is, then, a fact that has to be deliberately
forgotten by the sociologist or historian trying to understand why the
results of one experiment rather than another was believed at the time. 
In explaining the sources of belief one must act as though the speed of
light itself pla yed no part.  This is methodological relativism.
        Methodological relativism is common ground in SSK but over a
twenty year period there has been a continuing debate over more drastic
versions.  Every view, including radical ontological relativism has been
held by someone at some time.  There is nothing evil or dangerous about
such beliefs because they have no significant practical consequences. 
Whatever the belief, the practical consequences is methodological: `in a
sociological or historical investigation, act as though the world does not
constrain wh at scientists believe about it&apos;.  Aside from this, the
relativists beliefs are are a matter of philosophy.  These days I am a
methodological relativist, but if I were to wake up tomorrow as an
uncompromising ontological relativist, I would not want to cha nge one
word of the case studies in my books and papers. 
        Though my own views are now moderate this is not the point.  When
science starts to persecute people for their beliefs rather than their
results something has gone wrong.  That is why I refuse to respond to
Wolpert-like `accusations&apos; concerning relativis m.  To keep our
universities safe for ontological relativists, solipsists, or others who
want to experiment with radical philosophies, we must not accept a role in
a witch hunt - not even the role of innocent party (not all my colleagues
have seen this). 
 
        Let me turn now to the style of the few violent attacks on SSK
exemplified by Wolpert.  Science, like any other social institution,
relies on trust because not every scientist can check every fact.  With
trust comes an obligation to truthfulness, for if we were all to lie as
readily as we speak the truth then trust would cease to exist and
information would no longer be a property of discourse. 
        As Steven Shapin shows, (A Social History of Truth), in the
Seventeenth Century the Royal Society came to equate trustworthyness with
gentlemanly origins.  Boyle&apos;s experimental reports were trusted (as those
of his technicians were not), because Boyle wa s a gentleman.  In England,
science and social class became linked and to this day fellows of The
Royal Society are expected to act with decorum. 
        There are, then, a well-understood set of norms associated with
the proper conduct of scientific debate.  This means there are two ways of
attacking scientific `heresies&apos;.  `The first strategy&apos; is to attack the
content of the theories and findings `head on&apos;; `the second strategy&apos; is
to conspicuously break the norms of scientific debate, demonstrating that
the heresy is not to be treated as proper science (that which is worthy of
a gentlemanly response).  It may seem bizarre, but what one might call
`cons picuous incompetence&apos; can, then, have a role in the negotiation of
of truth.  The most salient recent example of this is Nature&apos;s attack on
Jacques Benveniste&apos;s claims about the homeopathic potency of water; Nature
took a team of unqualified persons and s taged a kind of scientific satire
in Benveniste&apos;s laboratory. 
        In Loughborough Wolpert said, and I paraphrase, that sociologists
had presented no evidence for their views, that sociologists had looked
only at fringe science and never at serious science, and that in the
writings of sociologists he found nothing but o bscurantism and hostility
to science.  On any normal interpretation he is wrong on all counts.  Why,
then did he say these things? 
        Let us once more take The Golem, which Wolpert read and reviewed. 
In The Golem he will have read eight case studies of the sort which are
used by sociologists and historians to back up their views of the nature
of science.  These include the studies of experiments to do with special
and general relativity, the origins of life (the Pasteur-Pouchet debate),
and the solar neutrino problem.  In the same source he will have read the
following (from the Preface and Conclusion respectively): `Each case study
d escribes a piece of beautiful scientific work.  But the beauty is not
the gloss of the philosopher&apos;s polishing wheel; it is the glint of rough
diamond.&apos; `Let us admire them [scientists] as craftspersons; the foremost
experts in the ways of the natural wo rld.&apos;
        Therefore when speaking at Loughborough Wolpert was aware that
historians and sociologists had presented what would normally be counted
as evidence for their views, that the case studies included what would
normally be counted as outstandingly successful
 science, and that there is a lot more to SSK than what would normally be
counted as hostility to science.  Furthermore, these issues had been
discussed in earlier interchanges (in, for example, The Times Literary
Supplement).  As for obscurantism, Nature &apos;s review of The Golem (written
by a life scientist), suggested: `... the writing is deft, the stories are
good, and there is not a boring page.&apos;
        I think that Wolpert&apos;s choice of style in these debates is a
matter of `the second strategy&apos;; he wants to demonstrate that SSK is to be
treated as outside the body of what is normally considered to be
scientific work. 
        Over 25 years SSK has slowly and painfully developed a methodology
and assembled a series of case studies of scientific practice.  Like any
other social science, SSK cannot work at the speed of the experimental
sciences because we have to wait for natura lly occurring instances of our
phenomena which are themselves long-term events. 
        Furthermore, the phenomena of the social sciences tend to `bite
back&apos; and this means that social science is always disputed - it would be
an uncomfortable world were it otherwise.  As it happens, nearly all those
who describe themselves under the label S SK are lovers of science. 
        The approach is to try to establish a new way of looking at the
scientific enterprise that values it for its expertise rather than its
promise of a resolution to all uncertainty and doubt; the object is to
undo the damage that has been done by oversellin g science.  We hope, as
we say in the Preface to the paperback edition of The Golem, that `...
those who may be put off a scientific career because of its cold,
impersonal, automaton-like, precision, may take comfort in the discovery
that it has a warm, e veryday, exciting, argumentative aspect, just like
the arts or social sciences.&apos;</segment>

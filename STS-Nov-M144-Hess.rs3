    <segment id="1" parent="49" relname="span">Following comments by Fuller, Weinstein, and Durbin, a critical issue in
determining how to respond to denigration of STS as an enterprise may
be first to address how STS is framed by the critics.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="1" relname="elaboration">  Are we
presented as a unitary group, with common goals and methods?</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="33" relname="span">  Are the
STS critiques most odious to true believers in the technoscience community
presented as representative of all?</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="31" relname="span">  

There is an issue here of
representation, quite familiar to contemporary ethnographers.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="4" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  As the
members of the communities where they work become more sophisticated
in their understanding of how ethnography represents them to other,
often more powerful communities,</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="29" relname="span"> subjects of ethnographies  
are becoming increasingly
critical of ethnographers.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="24" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  As we make representations of scientists
and their practices to others,</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="30" relname="span"> we are bound to upset some of them, and
generate backlash.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="25" relname="preparation">  I agree, in part, with Fuller;</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="34" relname="span"> we can&apos;t avoid this 
altogether without giving up our enterprise.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="52" relname="span">  What we might be able to
do is work against polarization.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="37" relname="span">  One approach is to refuse to cede the
ability to represent STS to technoscience communities to our critics.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="9" relname="motivation">
The backlash will raise the interest of technoscientists in our
work and might serve as a wedge, creating an opportunity for placing
articles discussing STS in forums attended to by technoscientists.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="35" relname="span">
Emphasizing the diversity of STS might force future critics to specify
more exactly what they are aiming at, a closer reading of the STS
literature.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">  Push the misreading issue until they are forced to
specify so precisely  that it becomes clear to what degree they are
attacking demons of their own imagining than anything that observers
would recognize as the general field of STS.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="36" relname="span">  In effect we would be saying 
that the attacks are too loosely specified to have any purchase on the 
issues they raise,</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="13" relname="background"> an argument that practitioners of technoscience are
familiar with in their own fields.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="41" relname="preparation">  

Caveats: </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="43" relname="span"> This works only to the extent that the backlash is off
target, of course.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="27" relname="concession">  I hope you will forgive me for not having gone to
the sources to read G&amp;L et al, and relying on what I have read in this
forum.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="42" relname="span">  The other issue is to what extent emphasizing diversity within
STS may prove divisive within our enterprise.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="40" relname="span">  I agree with the
observation that feminist work critical to the field of STS.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="28" relname="condition">  If this
variety of STS is indeed the prime target of backlash,</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="39" relname="span"> emphasizing
diversity without acknowledging the role of feminist theory could be
seen as abandoning colleagues.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="48" relname="span">

By the way, I hope the comment about the threat to our
academic prestige, funding, faculty openings, and graduate students of
failing to respond to the backlash was written with at least a wry
grin if not tongue-in-cheek.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="47" relname="span">  In terms of academic politics and group
dynamics, I often find STS so little different from the
technoscience we critique!</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="46" relname="span">   Does this answer Bailar&apos;s question about
what the goal of our whole enterprise is?</segment>

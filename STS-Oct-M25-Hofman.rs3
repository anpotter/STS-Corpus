    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="antithesis">BOUZID thinks &quot;the trick is to present our message
to these scientists in such a way that the false impression
given that we are anti-science is avoided&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="41" relname="span"> My general 
impression from GROSS &amp; Levitt was that the real trick for some
will be to avoid the appearance that it is *non*science.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="4" relname="condition"> If you go 
around insisting that people (&quot;blue-collar&quot; or otherwise) take 
you seriously,</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="42" relname="span"> you might figure they are going to read you carefully.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="6" relname="background">
But there is no need for anyone to speak for Paul Gross.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="57" relname="span"> He is a
gentlemanly if occasionally ascerbic participant in this list,
a fact that gives the lie to statements like this, from BOUZID:</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="antithesis">

        &quot;these people have absolutely no interest whatsoever in
        getting involved in any sort of constructive exchange
        with us. Their intentions are as transparent as their aversion
        for us.. So, reacting to them by developing an argument
        would be foolhardy, not to say pathetic.&quot; </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="concession">

I never much liked symmetry,</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="55" relname="span"> but there&apos;s no getting away from it
this time.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="53" relname="disjunction"> Many scientists would happily appropriate
BOUZID&apos;s claim, that &quot;enough work has been done already for 
anyone who is operating in good faith&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="54" relname="span"> Or they might swap some
nouns with FULLER:</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration"> &quot;[Some] STSers just want to be left alone to do
science studies, and if scientists want to challenge STS claims, they 
should study up on the subject first. It&apos;s a kind of academic freedom 
defense...&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="14" relname="concession"> At various points in the earlier exchanges on G&amp;L, it was 
grudgingly conceded that the scientific base of certain STS authors
was weak or worse,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="60" relname="span"> but the claim was commonly made that this did
not necessarily reduce the value of that work, at least for some
purposes.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="59" relname="span"> Now we find folks insisting that scientists must be  
steeped in STS in order to make worthwhile commentary on it, or even
be admitted to the discussion,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="elaboration"> while some scientists claim a place at
the table.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="58" relname="evaluation"> The uneveness of these responses invites the goose and
gander argument that M.LEE clearly made.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="19" relname="concession">

Similarly, although COLLINS has since had his own say,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="43" relname="span"> FULLER
noted that COLLINS &quot;likes science&quot;,</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="44" relname="span"> and so his view apparently
is a balanced one.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="62" relname="span"> Some may still recall how little ice was cut
in the other direction when people (FULLER included) noted the
sympathy of G&amp;L for certain progressive causes.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="21" relname="evaluation"> &quot;Yeah, but&quot; was
all you heard.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="63" relname="span">

Despite Bouzid&apos;s demurals, I&apos;d like to see some constructive
exchange.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="25" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> One of the principals is apparently listening in,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="45" relname="span"> so
there is no need for anyone to paraphrase his arguments. </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="46" relname="span">
I am most interested in the claim that current science studies
sometimes act to &quot;subvert the standards of reason and proof&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="26" relname="elaboration">

For example, a chapter in G&amp;L deals with environmental issues.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="47" relname="span">
I am assuming that those who want to challenge their views have
studied up on the subject first,</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="28" relname="antithesis"> and that they are not just,
as HAMLETT would have it, &quot;following the lead of the few... who 
have published attacks&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="52" relname="span"> In my view, G&amp;L come close to undermining 
their entire thesis by apparently buying the argument of Stephen 
Schneider that political goals may make it necessary to:</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="30" relname="elaboration">

        &quot;offer up scary scenarios, make simplified
        dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts
        that we might have... Each of us has to decide what the
        right balance is between being effective and being 
        honest&quot;. (p.168)</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="30" relname="elaboration">

In what way does this differ from the personalized reconstructions
of scientific ideas that G&amp;L routinely excoriate in their book?</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="30" relname="elaboration">
On what basis do they grant the &quot;influential atmospheric 
scientist&quot; Schneider so much slack?</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="49" relname="span"> They &quot;are not eager to
condemn it out of hand&quot;,</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="34" relname="concession"> though eagerness can fairly be said to
characterize their review of certain others.</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="50" relname="span"> Their mild protestations
are for once mainly pragmatic:</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="36" relname="elaboration"> &quot;Scientists, having deliberately
blurred [certain] niceties in raising the alarm, will be hard
pressed to call them to their defense if a particular alarm
turns out false&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="30" relname="elaboration"> Is there something here that might serve to
focus the discussion about the relative merits of inflated
claims in one&apos;s own field vs. simplistic ones in other fields? </segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="40" relname="concession">
I have my own thoughts on this,</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="64" relname="span"> but I would be delighted to
hear more, particularly from the author.</segment>

    <segment id="1" parent="50" relname="list">FULLER wrote a few days ago that STS is not anti science, but anti something. </segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="50" relname="list">
HAKKEN asked him implicitly to be more specific</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="50" relname="list"> and BAILAR asked even for a 
positive contribution of STS for scientists. </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="54" relname="span">I think the last question is 
more appropriate.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="52" relname="span"> At least you have to be able to give an answer to it.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="7" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> Else 
you stick to an easy criticism,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="51" relname="span"> and scientists are right</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="53" relname="span"> if they blame STS</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="nonvolitional-result"> if 
it can only criticize. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="55" relname="span">

To think of positive contribution we must leave the idea that STS should be 
against something.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="background"> Or &quot;something&quot; is &quot;things that are not going as well as 
they could go&quot;. </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="81" relname="span">But then it is an easy statement.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="84" relname="span"> Scientists and other people 
involved in science (editors, science policy makers, research councils, 
firms, public) face problems in how science goes and how it is embedded in 
society.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="83" relname="span"> And you can link to such problems to show the positive contributions 
STS can make.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="56" relname="background">

Let me give three examples for traditional areas of STS interest:</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="80" relname="span">
1. Biotechnology and public acceptance.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="solutionhood"> What do we see as the role of STS. </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="60" relname="span">
Analyse ethical problems of biotechnology and possible (negative) societal 
effects.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="58" relname="span"> That is a good role but only a halve one.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="57" relname="span"> Can we also think of using 
our in insights in how biotechnological research is part of society and how 
ethical problems can be dealt with in a &apos;good&apos; way</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="elaboration"> (that is without building 
&apos;expert-boundaries&apos; to avoid public debate)?</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="57" relname="evidence"> At least in the Netherlands 
government and biotechnological firms are willing to engage in research that 
try to find ways for dealing in a non-pavlov way with ethical problems and 
public (un)acceptance.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="66" relname="span">

2. Nuclear waste management.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="25" relname="solutionhood"> What do we see as the role of STS.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="65" relname="span"> Again one can 
reveal traditional experts tricks to create own domains of expertise and try 
to use scientific evidence as a proof that nuclear waste can be dealt with in 
a save way.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="61" relname="span"> That is a good role but only a halve one.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="62" relname="span"> What for instance to do 
with an request of the government to analyse a public debate on nuclear waste 
management?</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="27" relname="elaboration"> Take side against the experts?</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="63" relname="span"> Or can STS make use of its 
insights in the force and weaknesses of science and show how both sides make 
use of &quot;scientific evidence&quot; to underscore their opinions.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="64" relname="span"> An STS analyses of 
such debates can make clear that their are limitations to scientific evidence 
and that at a certain moment decisions -be it pro or contra- have to be made 
under uncertainty.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="30" relname="evidence"> In the Netherlands again such advice was attached to a 
governmental White Paper to legitimate the ultimate decision.  </segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="67" relname="span">               
                         
3. Funding of theoretical and high energy physics after the Cold War. </segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="32" relname="elaboration">
Apparently the end of the Cold War has put an end also to much of the 
legitimation of hughe investments in high energy physics, nuclear physics and 
related expensive areas.</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="35" relname="solutionhood"> What is the role of STS?</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="38" relname="span"> Reveal how funding of 
science is one of the social links of science that always has been an 
amendment to too easy claims for autonomy?</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="35" relname="elaboration"> And reveal how physicists try to 
get support for their projects by making unjustified claims on the relation 
between scientific progress and this kind of investments, on the good things 
science will eventually but certainly give to society, on the nations future 
depending on these investments?</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="68" relname="span"> Again that is a good role, but only a halve 
one.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="37" relname="evidence"> In the Netherlands science studies are involved in discussions on 
priority setting and are frequently asked for their contribution to improve 
existing practices. </segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="76" relname="span">

I would really like to hear from the U.S side of the waterfront whether 
people could think of contributions from STS side that improve such 
discssions.</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="42" relname="condition"> If you can think of such contribution intellectually, </segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="71" relname="span">there must 
be a social possibility as well.</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="44" relname="condition"> If you cannot, </segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="70" relname="span">STS should be modest on its 
criticism of scientists asking for more money.</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="46" relname="concession">

Finally, the examples I gave and the solution I see are in my opinion a step 
towards &apos;democratisation&apos; of technoscientific issues.</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="74" relname="span"> But I realize that is a 
specific meaning of democracy. </segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="48" relname="condition">I think if we really want to push that issue 
&quot;democratisation&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="72" relname="span"> we should be more specific on what we mean with that,</segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="72" relname="otherwise"> else 
it is just easy flag waving to get people uncritically walking behind you.</segment>

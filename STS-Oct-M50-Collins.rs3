Re Schmauss&apos;s puzzlement about whigg history etc.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="33" relname="span">

There is nothing in my piece that is incompatible with a thoroughgoing 
unwhiggish approach to the histgory of science. </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="23" relname="span"> That is why I am 
surprised to have been attacked even by my colleagues (eg Hilary Rose, Steve
Woolgar [in latest THES]). </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="32" relname="span"> I wrote what I thought would be a piece that 
would be pretty inoffensive to almost anyone concerned with these topics;</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="4" relname="background">
one lives and learns!</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="34" relname="span">

The only difference between the methodological relativism that I espoused
in THES, and what, some others might do, is methodological.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="8" relname="antithesis">  To achieve
thoroughgoing unwhiggishness amounts to forgetting the `truth&apos; about what
is being argued. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="24" relname="span"> Proclaiming one&apos;s sensitivity to non-retrospection is
rarely enough when it comes to the history of science.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="background">  Rational
reconstruction a la Lakatos, by the way, seems to be something 
completely different. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="35" relname="span">

As for the aether, the story is not mine. </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="25" relname="span"> I took it from Michael Polanyi and
Lloyd Swenson</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="background"> (as is made clear in the Preface to The Golem).</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="11" relname="background">  [I also used
some original sources]. </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="11" relname="elaboration"> Neither were/are noted relativists.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="36" relname="span">  The same 
applies, of course, to the Eddington story - which we took from Earman and
Glymour.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  It seems to me, however, that what they have done is studies which
are genuinely unwhiggish</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="26" relname="span"> and therefore amount to their having done their 
history while forgetting the outcome.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="elaboration">  Methodological relativism formalises
and tightens this principle.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="27" relname="span">

Finally, re Lakatos, the point is not that Michelson was checking on 
theories of the luminiferous aether</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="background"> [in any case, Swenson says they were 
trying to measure the speed of the Earth],</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="37" relname="span"> the point is that whatever they
were looking for the best experiments seemed to find an aether drift at 
least until the 1930s.</segment>

PS Readers might be interested to know that this morning the BBC (Start the
Week with Melving Bragg), had a programme discussing the Loughborough debate.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="31" relname="span">
I had no inkling of this</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="28" relname="circumstance"> until a colleague mentioned to me that he had heard
it.</segment>

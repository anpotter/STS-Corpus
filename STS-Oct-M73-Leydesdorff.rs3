I strongly support the views brought forward in earlier messages of Paul
Edwards and Barend van der Meulen about respectfully working with natural
scientists and engineers on establishing new relations between science,
technology and society.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="19" relname="span"> There is a whole generation of scientists and
engineers who are keenly aware about the social relations of the sciences,
and who wish to develop new programs which include social and scientific
qualifications, including a STS perspective.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="concession"> The latter, of course, as long
as it is a contribution to their program, i.e., the programme of the
enlightenment.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="20" relname="span">
 
Personally, I have recently worked more than half a year as the secretary
of an interfaculty advisory committee of the Board of the University of
Amsterdam.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="16" relname="span"> In the committee we try to draft new programmes for
freshmanyears, including both social science and natural science subjects.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="13" relname="span">
It is always a pleasure:</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> most people are really interested in philosophy,
history and sociology of science.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="17" relname="span"> In my opinion, the hostility in the
debate is an artifact of the extreme positions by some of our colleagues.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="15" relname="span">
These extreme positions are sometimes perceived as anti-scientific.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="11" relname="concession"> (Of
course, there are also hard core conservatives,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="14" relname="span"> but among scientists they
are usually a minority.)</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="18" relname="span">
 
Thus, I think that we should more clearly distinguish between our sometimes
esoteric research interests and the discourse which we maintain with our
colleagues in other disciplines.</segment>

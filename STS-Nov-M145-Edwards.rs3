&amp;gt;Although I suppose I am a &quot;constructivist&quot; in my theory of knowledge and
&amp;gt;social theory, I am not a relativist, methodological or otherwise.  I don&apos;t
&amp;gt;know why these are always linked. BUT, why would relativism count against
&amp;gt;academic freedom? Wouldn&apos;t the most obvious political implication be a
&amp;gt;concern with expanded, more effective academic freedom as against allegedly
&amp;gt;free but in fact coercive institutions?</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="4" relname="concession">

This would seem to be the natural conclusion,</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="22" relname="span"> but in fact it need not be,
and often isn&apos;t.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="6" relname="concession"> Relativism (both epistemological and moral) is often taken
as requiring tolerance of different views and values.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="24" relname="span"> But it doesn&apos;t.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="8" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> In
fact, since tolerance itself is an absolute value (not a relative one),</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="25" relname="span"> a
consistent relativist cannot hold that even this value should be required
of everyone -- even of him or herself -- nor that it follows from
relativism</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="elaboration"> (it doesn&apos;t). </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="11" relname="antithesis">

A relativist culture and/or moral code would, by definition, recognize the
existence and validity of other epistemologies or moral values.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="27" relname="span"> But
recognizing their existence in no way requires that other
codes/epistemologies be _tolerated, upheld, or even respected_.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="34" relname="span"> This is the
case, for example, with some of the more extreme speech codes and other
politically-correct policies introduced on university campuses in the last
decade.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="32" relname="span"> These recognize the cultural basis of beliefs and values and their
large variation;</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="31" relname="span"> they prohibit insults against non-mainstream
views/cultures precisely in order to strengthen and encourage them,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="14" relname="volitional-cause">
precisely because they are different.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="33" relname="span"> Yet they make expressing _some_
beliefs/values grounds for explusion from the community.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="concession"> Such codes can be
read as embodiments and logical consequences of a moral and possibly an
epistemological relativism</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="28" relname="span"> -- but certainly not of academic freedom, free
speech, or other Enlightenment values, which are by definition absolutes.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="29" relname="span">
(Here we get into the hall-of-mirrors problem relativism also involves,</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="volitional-cause">
since one could also read these codes as embodying absolute values about
which particular cultures/beliefs are allowed respect and expression and
which are not.)</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="37" relname="summary">

This confusion between relativism and tolerance, which are rather more
opposite than alike, lies at the root of a lot of our recent debates on
this net.</segment>

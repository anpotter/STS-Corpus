&amp;gt; But what do you mean about STS taking the political consequences of
&amp;gt; their epistemological commitments more seriously? I never thought of
&amp;gt; science studies as a program for idle chatter or navel-gazing.... I&apos;ve
&amp;gt; always respected STS as	 being rather more politically astute than the
&amp;gt; somnulent drek that often passes as historical scholarship... Perhaps I

A lot depends on what you mean by &apos;politically astute&apos;.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="24" relname="span"> For some in this
field, being &apos;politically astute&apos; means making oneself usable as a
resource in many different contexts by not explicitly raising the

vary so much across contexts that there&apos;s much one can do about it, except
to fight specific political battles one cares about deeply.</segment>

indication of the difficulty these days to make &apos;political consequences&apos; a

However hide-bound you (or I!) may think the historical profession is in 
the US,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="34" relname="span"> the fact remains that the professional identity of American

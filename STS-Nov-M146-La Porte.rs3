STS list in general:

I&apos;ve been lurking on this list for a bit becoming increasingly puzzled by
the shape and tone of the exchanges.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="1" relname="circumstance">  At the same time, I&apos;ve been deleting
files and came across the one enclosed.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="30" relname="span">  It seemed a propos somehow at
this juncture in your/our social constructions. </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="evidence"> Work of the sort
suggested below might provide a more substantial basis for &quot;backlashes&quot;
and antagonisms. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="3" relname="evidence"> It might also address other needs and possibilities of
STS work (and students who look us up as if we were relevent) that is not 
now claiming attention from within or without. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="41" relname="span">

&amp;gt;From a letter the National Science Foundation, 12-22-1991, commenting on 
a draft announcement for a Research on Research and Technology program </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="6" relname="elaboration">
(not much seemed to come of it but I&apos;ve stopped looking to the NSF for much.)</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="25" relname="span">

&quot;The questions/issues listed to illustrate the types of (acceptable, 
suggested research) interests are wide ranging but almost wholly devoted 
either to the sociology of investigators, or to the processes and 
institutional settings involved in producing or disseminating more 
scientific knowledge or technical innovations.  The list ... suggests 
that the real emphasis of the program will (and should) be on the 
processes, inputs, and outputs of research and technological innovation 
with very little encouragement concerning the questions of the impacts or 
consequences of deploying new technologies widely throughout 
organizations or society at large.&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="28" relname="span">

I felt then and now that thses are quite lopsided, indeed unbalanced, 
perhaps pernicious emphases. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="26" relname="span"> A parallel set of research concerns is 
required, I believe,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="condition"> if we are to improve the types of knowledge 
necessary to inform the technical, academic and policy communities 
involved. </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="27" relname="span"> I indicate some below. </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="14" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> They were drafted a bit hastily due to 
time constraints</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="24" relname="span"> so they are by no means complete.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="27" relname="elaboration">  At the same time, I 
see very little progress in either our systematic (STS, TA, soc. sci.) 
understanding of the relations outlined, or in the availability of funds 
for their pursuit (from NSF or any other agency).</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="38" relname="preparation">
 
&quot;There are no issues or questions stimulating research on, for example, 
matters of: </segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="39" relname="span">

a) The effects of technologies on everyday life (in settings other than 
technology producing institutions),</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="31" relname="elaboration"> e.g., the effects of technologies on 
the use of time and other aspects of in household behavior, changes of 
adolescent perceptions of the world as consequences of continuous global 
news media, or the effects on social behavior associated with the new 
medical capabilities in intensive care for premature infants and the elderly.</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="40" relname="span">

b) The effects of widely deployed technologies whose negative and 
unexpected positive effects become recognizable only when they reach wide 
scale deployment,</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="32" relname="elaboration"> e.g., automobiles noxious emissions, wide scale 
dependence on high speed transfer of financial information within and 
across national boundaries, and  unexpected uses of Minitel in France.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="38" relname="list">

c) The effects on public and private institutions when the society 
becomes dependent on technologies so intrinsically hazardous in their 
design that they prompt pressures for very high levels of reliable 
performance as a condition of their benefits, such a nuclear power 
generation, air traffic control, sea transport of crude oil, and the 
development of new types of biological and genetic materials.</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="38" relname="list">

d) The effects on legal and political institutions when technologies are 
designed and deployed that have characteristics which (usually 
inadvertently) prompt public apprehension and fears and, hence, invite 
government regulation, such as job displacing systems, environmentally 
destructive processes, and technologies like those listed in c) above.</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="38" relname="list">

e) The criteria and dynamics in technological design processes which 
might take into account social and regulatory impacts as well as economic 
benefits.&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="38" relname="interpretation">

These all have to do with the uses of scientific knowledge made manifest 
as physical and organizational phenomena.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="42" relname="summary">  These sort of questions can 
and should be the object of systematic inquiry -- potentially the source 
of strategies and design knowledge -- that could inform decision making 
and operational development. </segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="50" relname="span"> STSers could turn to such questions</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="concession"> (though 
I am not persuaded they/we are now particularly skilled in doing so).</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="50" relname="motivation"> The 
result should be a more fully formed basis for affirming (new or 
continuing) technical systems in the interest of more than &quot;technical&quot; or 
&quot;economic&quot; progress.</segment>

    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="concession">I liked Paul Edwards&apos; comments</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="47" relname="span">, but I would like to point out that the
problem might be a good deal deeper than the &quot;attitudes&quot;  of STS
researchers.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="elaboration"> (Also, that line feeds in an unfortunate way to Gross, who
seems to think that STSers will know enough science and have the right
attitude when they say about Science what scientists themselves would
say.)</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="48" relname="span">

The problem seems to emerge from the process of redescription. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="29" relname="span"> Using an
alternative vocabulary to redescribe a practice seems to automatically
destablize it</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="circumstance"> -- even if that was not part of the intention behind the
redescription!</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="30" relname="span">  So, if we use social, economic or rhetorical vocabularies
to redescribe science, no matter how great our respect and good
intentions,</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="42" relname="span"> the effect, for participants and observers, is that an
effective redescription destablizes science as a genuine practice. </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="28" relname="span">
(Latour, e.g., seems to express endless puzzlement that anybody reacts
negatively to his very thick redescriptions</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="9" relname="antithesis"> -- as if their accuracy
precluded that!)</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="31" relname="preparation">

Two things should be noted immediately:</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="33" relname="span">

--the problem also runs the other way as way;</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="evidence"> witness the dicomfiture of
the religious and social thinkers as their values and preferred modes of
life are redescribed by sociobiologists in terms of gene preservation and
such,</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="12" relname="evidence"> or how offensive many people find computational descriptions of
intelligence. </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="32" relname="span">

--redescriptions of Science by philosophers, for the most part, don&apos;t 
seem to destablize it, which makes one wonder if an alternative vocablary 
is actually in play.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="evaluation"> :)</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="44" relname="span">

What I don&apos;t know, at this point, is if there as any way to avoid this
destablization problem, or even its exact etiology.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="elaboration">  In general nobody, I
think, likes to be redescribed, either as a product of Freudian forces, or
a carrier for genes, or as a wetware computational device</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="41" relname="span"> -- what&apos;s at
issue here?  </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="elaboration"> Thoughts?  </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="36" relname="span">

Edwards wants science to be permeable and accountable</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="21" relname="background"> (and so do I)</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="39" relname="span"> but do
accomplish this, he&apos;s going to have to invoke a redescription of science
and scientific practice which will make Gross uncomfortable,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="circumstance"> no matter how
much he appreciates Edwards&apos; respect and goodwill.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="37" relname="span">  In addition, Gross
seems to take any redescription as a sort of &quot;net translation loss,&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="24" relname="concession"> where
the acheivements of Science since 1580 disappear in a haze of STS talk. </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="27" relname="condition">
Edwards&apos; comment make clear that he (and, likely, many others) don&apos;t see
this implication.</segment>

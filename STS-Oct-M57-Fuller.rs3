    <segment id="1" parent="45" relname="preparation">REPLY TO SHANKS, PHILIPPSON, GALE</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="2" relname="antithesis">

First off, SHANKS claims that philosophers of scinece don&apos;t see 
themselves as underlaborers to scientists,</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="29" relname="span"> but in fact several have 
openly embraced this Lockean image.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="evidence"> In his book of interviews with 
philosophers of science, Werner Callebaut observed this pattern very 
strongly.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="27" relname="span"> Some guys, like Robert Brandon, made it very clear that  the 
scientists set the agenda for philosophers of science</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="28" relname="span"> (at least teh ones 
he associates with).</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="justify"> I made a big deal about this in the review I did of 
Callebaut&apos;s book in _Science_ (May 94).</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="30" relname="span"> Philosophers involved in 
cognitive science also talk this way.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="7" relname="evidence"> (I recall Jerry Fodor invoking the 
underlaborer image a couple of times in his books.)</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="10" relname="condition">

Moreover, if you see the work of philosophy of science as primarily one 
of clarifying concepts and arguments -- as SHANKS seems to --</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="34" relname="span"> then you&apos;ve 
embraced the underlaborer role.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="35" relname="span"> The only sort of criticism being provided 
is internal to the scientific enterprise.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="circumstance"> In fact, when you survey the 
assortment of philosophers of science who line up between this or that 
side in current theoretical controversies in science,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="33" relname="span"> it&apos;s easy to get 
the impression that the philosophers are functioning much like defense 
attorneys providing their clients with a clearer voice than the clients 
themselves could.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="32" relname="span"> (Of course, minus the connotation that the attorneys 
might bend a premise here or there to help the client win.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="14" relname="evaluation"> Needless to 
say, philosophical reconstructions of the history of science that 
vindicate realism or instrumentalism would NEVER count as examples of 
such behavior.)</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="concession">

I know that some of you out there will think I am being incredibly unfair
to philosophers of science by saying these things.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="41" relname="span"> Nevertheless, I would
ask you to think about the suspicion with which people trained in the more
traditional branches of philosophy (epistemology, metaphysics, ethics --
but not the applied stuff) often regard philosophers of science.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="36" relname="span"> Many in
these fields feel that philosophers of science have simply surrendered the
domain of philosophical inquiry to the scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="37" relname="span"> In fact, &quot;naturalism&quot;
is often presented as a reasoned defense of such a move.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="39" relname="span"> Admittedly, this 
tension between philosophers of science and other philosophers often 
surfaces very abstractly.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="circumstance"> For example, when guys like Barry Stroud 
chastise naturalists for not taking the problem of skepticism 
sufficiently seriously,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="38" relname="span"> a big part of what he&apos;s doing is to question 
whether naturalists are capable of having the critical independence 
necessary for doing philosophy. </segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="44" relname="span">

In any case, it does seem to me that philosophers of science -- of the
underlaboring variety -- have a vested interest in science in a way that
other philosophers do not have in other institutions.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="40" relname="span"> The only possible
exception is the vested interest that many philosophers of religion have
in the promotion of religion (by showing that those proofs of God&apos;s
existence really follow). </segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="24" relname="concession"> But even then, the philosophers of religion 
tend to be committed to broader conceptions of religion (i.e. not so tied 
to a particular sect) than philosophers of science vis-a-vis science.</segment>

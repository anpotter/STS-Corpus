    <segment id="1" parent="27" relname="span">I have followed the discussion on Sts and its critics with a half an eye</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="1" relname="background"> (as 
we can say in Dutch),</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="44" relname="span"> but now Harry Marks has posed some more interesting 
questions I like to join.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="28" relname="span"> I can feel sympathetic to scientists complaining 
that STS&apos;ers deconstruct their traditional legitimation,</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="4" relname="elaboration"> especially if they 
call themselves constructivists, but do not feel the responsibility to add 
something constructive to the science-society relation.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="43" relname="span"> Mark Hinelines 
aesthetics of science will hardly help those scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="8" relname="preparation"> 

Well let me explain my own background.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="40" relname="span"> I am one of those working in the group 
that came up already in the discussion:</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="elaboration"> the University of Twente group.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="41" relname="span"> We 
indeed have some people working within an engineering science program on 
micro-optics.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="42" relname="span"> But generally our relations with scientists, firms,governments 
and all those guys and institutions that make this world running so badly are 
quite positive.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="antithesis"> That is, we do not adopt one dimensional legitimations or 
policy stories.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="29" relname="span"> But instead of just criticizing them, as part of some 
alternative program, we feel also responsible for the creation of new 
legitimations.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="30" relname="conjunction"> So, some of us work with biotechnological firms on issues like 
technology assessment and public acceptance.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="30" relname="conjunction"> And others can get the 
participation of genetic engineering scientists to study it.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="36" relname="span">

I myself try to be constructive in science policy and presently working part 
time for the Dutch Foresight Program --again with real scientist.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="concession"> Althought 
my PhD thesis has recently been criticed in the EASST Newsletter of not being 
relevant for science policy, </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="35" relname="span">it turns out that the research I did on science 
policy can be put positively into use to design foresight processes, to write 
draft opinion papers for the foresight committee on issues like fundamental 
science, priority setting and the like.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="20" relname="concession"> All right, I have to compromise 
sometimes,</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="33" relname="span"> but the insights STS studies give on have science works and how it 
is embedded in society is a good source to improve tradional legitimations.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="32" relname="span"> 
One of the main lessons I repeatedly bring in is that general statements 
about science society relations are only usefull as a starting point.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="23" relname="condition"> If you 
want to do something really effective,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="31" relname="span"> you have to adjust the policy 
instruments, or more specific the foresight process to the specific context. </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="33" relname="summary">
STS and constructivist science policy studies provide part of the tool box 
that enables you to analyse the specific context.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="26" relname="antithesis">

Well, I cannot give a full overview of my experiences,</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="38" relname="span"> but I really think 
that STS is better served by seeking and articulating constructive roles (in 
both senses!) in all kind of science-society relations, than complaining 
about criticism.</segment>

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Nobody is denying that philosophical considerations have informed and 
&amp;gt; motivated scientific work. In fact, it would be hard to comprehend the 
&amp;gt; point of doing science without smuggling in philosophy. However, there 
&amp;gt; are still a few open questions. First, whether scientists really need a 
&amp;gt; class of people called &apos;philosophers of science&apos; to help them with their 
&amp;gt; philosophizing. Second, whether philosophers of science should be in the 
&amp;gt; business of &apos;helping scientists&apos; rather than doing something a bit more 
&amp;gt; independent and/or critical. 
&amp;gt; </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="60" relname="span">
To pursue a biological metaphor, at least some &quot;strains&quot; of analytic 
philosophy of science (viewed as a species of philosophy of science) 
which aim at the clarification and elucidation of theoretical terms, 
and the logic of arguments that contain them -- these are not fields 
where science has exclusive claims to turf,</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="57" relname="span"> and yet such analyses can 
be important to scientists -- especially those with a taste for 
theory.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="43" relname="span">  Such analyses occasionally turn up paradoxes and 
inconsistencies which are then the spur for further scientific 
(and philosophical) investigation. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="4" relname="elaboration"> Philosophers of science (again, 
of an analytic variety) have historically been concerned with 
questions of evidence (and the quality theoreof).</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="58" relname="span">  Such concerns can 
be of genuine scientific relevance. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="8" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> In this sense, especially 
insofar as it is hard to separate the concerns of theoretical science 
from philosophy of science,</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="56" relname="span"> it may be possible to make a case for 
having specialists in philosophy of science.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="42" relname="solutionhood">

Should they be critical? </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="42" relname="list"> Yes, if theoretical terms are unclear, are 
being used inappropriately,</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="42" relname="list"> if arguments are fallacious,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="42" relname="list"> and if 
evidence for claims is less conclusive than advertized.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="61" relname="span">

None of this involves SCIENCE ENVY or indeed a slavish worship of 
science</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="11" relname="concession"> -- though it does seem to require a penchant for critical 
thinking.  </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="16" relname="solutionhood">

Was it Locke who characterized philosophers as underlaborers to 
science?</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="62" relname="span">  I know of few contemporary philosophers of science who 
would characterize themselves as mere underlaborers?</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="67" relname="span">

&amp;gt; The most interesting philosophers of science in this century were 
not
&amp;gt; slavish worshippers of science, but in fact had conceptions of the
&amp;gt; scientific enterpirse that went against the standing trends. I include
&amp;gt; here not only Popper, Lakatos, and Feyerabend, but also the logical
&amp;gt; positivists -- since by the time those guys were writing, it was clear
&amp;gt; already that you&apos;d have to do a major overhaul of scientific communication
&amp;gt; patterns if you wanted to take the idea of &apos;unity of science&apos; seriuously. 
&amp;gt; </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="evaluation">
Agreed. </segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="20" relname="antithesis">

&amp;gt; When science studies people rail against philosophy of science, 
their 
&amp;gt; target is usually the rhetoric that scientists use to discuss their 
&amp;gt; activities in public -- appeals to truth, objectivity, rationality etc -- 
&amp;gt; that wreak of philosophical origins, but that don&apos;t seem to be needed to 
&amp;gt; explain how science actually occurs. Consequently, the philosophical 
&amp;gt; rhetoric appears to be a mystification, whcih ends up inflating 
&amp;gt; everyone&apos;s expectations about what science can do -- something that is in 
&amp;gt; no one&apos;s interest. From this standpoint, perhaps you can see why Latour 
&amp;gt; and Collins, say, might think that they are doing science a favor by 
&amp;gt; slaying the philosophical dragons. 
&amp;gt; </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="48" relname="span">
This is a tricky issue. </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="concession"> Certainly you are correct to note that talk 
of truth, objectivity, rationality, etc can be dangerous in 
uncritical hands. </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="46" relname="span"> But ideals such as these are not completely bereft 
of explanatory value</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="evidence"> -- they explain WHY many people choose careers 
in science,</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="22" relname="evidence"> why they think science is worth doing, etc.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="44" relname="span">  I do not 
deny that there are many reasons why science is done</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="25" relname="background"> (some of them -- 
perhaps in the context of BIG SCIENCE -- being of dubious morality), </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="45" relname="span">
but it seems premature to dismiss the pursuit of truth as being one 
of them.</segment>

An interesting case here is afforded by the debate over realism from 
the standpoint of the quantum theory.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="51" relname="span">  In the 1980s this 
philosophical debate took on the character of an experimental issue.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="50" relname="span">  
Aspect performed experiments which derived statistical patterns of 
measurement results which were apparently inconsistent with the 
predictions of a class of theories which respected the Lorentz 
invariance requirements of special relativity and yet made various 
assumptions about observer-independent quantum realities.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="30" relname="elaboration">  The 
results confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics.</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="33" relname="concession">  While there 
remain all sorts of questions about the experiments and the data,</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="49" relname="span"> the 
case here is an example of one of the ways in which philosophy of 
science can become inextricably intertwined with theoretical science 
in ways that may be open to experimental investigation.</segment>

about the right way to characterise realism seem pertinent in this 
branch of science.</segment>

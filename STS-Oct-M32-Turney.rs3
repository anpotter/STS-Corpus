To say science is a social construct seems to me to be a truism. How else
is science made except through human activity? It is closely connected
with other human interests: scientific knowledge plays an important part
in politics and other matters, and is not independent of them. But that does
not mean that it is not constrained by observation and experiment on the
natural world.
I think the sociology of science is fundamental to the understanding of
science. But sociology, the understanding of social systems and
interactions, is very broad, and is not to be hijacked by any one particular
school which talks about &quot;the sociology of science knowledge&quot; as if that
were all that need be said on the subject.
One of the key points which I think the &quot;strong programme&quot; people are
missing is that science itself is a peculiar social system, like any large
social organisation or institution. If they were serious sociologists, then
they would be looking at some of the broader social relationships which
make a lot of difference in the sort of knowledge that is produced. For
example, there is the traditional academic type of science where knowledge
had to be made public. Someone who had worked entirely in secret was
not a scientist, and what they claimed they had discovered could not be
considered scientific knowledge until it had been publicly tested by others. 
I like to use the word &quot;metascience&quot;, encompassing science studies
generally, bringing in bits of history, philosophy, sociology, psychology,
anthropology, economics, etcetera. People have long considered a historical
and philosophical point of view appropriate in thinking about the nature
of science, but it is quite inadequate if you don&apos;t see it as also involving
insights from the social sciences and humanities.

*********************************************************

To assert that science is a social construct is to confuse the fundamental
drives of scientific endeavour and the influences of social environments.
These influences may appear to cultivate, facilitate or constrain scientific
activity. In turn science has influenced and indeed become part of the
wider phenomena of social change.
It is clear that as a pursuit science can be regarded as a social occupation,
but is science nothing but an internal creation of society? Emphatically it
is not. While aspects of scientific thought and practice can be looked at as
 examples of thought and practice in general, and it is indeed false to
claim that science and society are autonomous entities with science
developing in some sort of cultural vacuum, it is the business of science
to transcend the social constraints and moderators and to set sights on the
underlying truths of nature. If conclusions to scientific debates seem
sometimes to be matters of social consensus this is only an ephemeral
condition. Any disputes in science are settled both by more careful
observation of the facts and from the perspective of an ever widening
knowledge bases. Normal science -- call it the ultimate problem-solving
activity -- is a highly cumulative enterprise, eminently successful in its
aim, the steady extension of the horizon and precision of natural
knowledge. This is not to deny that, at any time, our whole scientific
picture of the natural world is limited both by our understanding and the
methods available to us. This picture merely is a description of what we
observe and infer of a complex reality. It can never claim to be the
absolute truth but always it is the best picture we can have. 
In the last analysis what is perceived will depend on what is &quot;there&quot; to be
seen: this has no place in the social sphere. While it may be of interest to
sociologists to explore social influences in science it is simplistic, and
wrong, for them to assume ownership of science.
Similarly, in my view, the sociology of science has contributed nothing to
the understanding of science. Given the spectacular growth and success of
science it is tempting to associate this with the overall concurrent social
change. Science is indeed linked with society, by its practical application.
Whether in improving industrial processes, communications or medical
techniques, the effects of science are evident. But here one must make a
distinction between science and technology. Technology may be seen
 as a direct product of scientific endeavour, and science often can be
identified as the catalyst for developments in technology that have led to
social change, but these are not to be confused with the single-minded
exploration of nature that is the hallmark of basic science. 
With the above said, whether scientists ought to know what is going on in
the sociology of science is a matter for the individual. I believe is it of no
consequence to the practice or achievements of science to know how
sociologists assess scientific activity or what conclusions stem from this.
And from the point of view of the sociologist it is not necessary to care
at all about the scientific fact of theory whose pursuit by scientists is the
subject of study. But in so far as sociology impinges on the socio-
economic climate in which science is promoted and supported, then
scientists should know what is going on.

Lewis Wolpert is to be congratulated for standing up at the British
Association and blowing the whistle on chic drivel of the &quot;All knowledge
is a social construct and merits equal attention&quot; persuasion. 
A sociologist of science could usefully defend the more modest claim that
scientists are influenced by their own social and cultural background, but
this does not seem to have been the issue at Loughborough. Darwin might
have been inspried by Victorian economics when he thought of natural
selection. If true, this is an interesting contribution to the history of ideas,
but it does not affect the primary question of whether life does, as a matter
of fact evolve by natural selection. &quot;As a matter of fact&quot; is not a phrase
one should apologise for using.
I once put the following question to a social scientist colleague: &quot;Suppose
there is a tribe which believes that the moon is an old calabash tossed just
above the treetops. Are you saying that this tribe&apos;s belief is just as true as
 our scientific belief that the moon is a large Earth satellite about a quarter
of a million miles away?&quot; His reply was that truth is a social construct and
therefore the tribe&apos;s view of the moon is just as true as ours. That there
 is something deeply silly about this sort of thing soon appears when you
ask practical questions. If a consultant gastro-enterologist says that a
tribesman is suffering from cancer of the colon, and the tribe&apos;s own witch-
doctor says he is suffering from evil spirits, which treatment is, as a matter
of fact, most likely to cure him, a colonectomy or an exorcism? Why,
when Harry Collins was asked if he believed scientific knowledge to be
only a social construct, did he refuse to answer?

Western science works. The theory that leads a cargo-cult tribe to build a
wooden plane in a jungle clearing does not work. Admittedly the plane is
not meant to fly, but it doesn&apos;t even have its proposed effect of
summoning rich cargo-dispensing ancestors either. When you take a 747
to an international convention of sociologists or literary critics, the reason
you will arrive in one piece is that a lot of western-trained scientists and
engineers got their sums right. If it gives you satisfaction to say that the
theory of aerodynamics is a social construct that is your privilege, but why
do you then entrust your air-travel plans to a Boeing rather than a magic
carpet or a levitating fakir? As I have put it before, show me a cultural
relativist at 30,000 feet and I will show you a hypocrite.

The answer to the question &quot;Is science a social construct?&quot; seems to me so
obviously &quot;yes&quot; that only some misunderstanding about its meaning could
lead anyone to say &quot;no&quot;. Perhaps it is being confused with two related 
questions. 
First: Do you believe that the object of scientific investigation is a social
construct? My answer to this is no. The reason is that I am a realist: I
believe that there is a real world that exists independently of us 
even though we are entangled in it, and that we can obtain knowledge
about it. The second related question is: Do you believe that scientific
knowledge is a social construct? My answer to this is yes. Saying no
implies that scientific knowledge exists independently of human activity,
which requires that the knowledge be revealed to humans in some special
way: either from God, for instance, or by nature speaking directly through
special people. 
There may be scientists who feel that they are in the latter category, but
most of us take a more modest position and see scientific knowledge as
the product of the activities of scientists acting as social beings working
within a disciplinary framework into which they are socialised. The
knowledge that is constructed is independent of reality but the aim of
science is to adequately represent this reality.
The structure of science is clearly a social construct and the process of
science is a social activity. Four hundred years ago science as we know it
did not exist. It was not discovered on the beach one day. It was
constructed historically and socially. I believe that historians and
sociologists of science do an important job in examining this process. Why
did Darwin formulate his theory of evolution as he did? What were the
influences that led him to make certain assumptions and not others? It is
important for scientists to see theories in historical and social context, as
well as in relation to evidence, in order to consider options. Darwin&apos;s
theory as the conceptual basis of biology has severe limitations, and we
may expect that there will be another theory that does a better job both in
understanding biological reality and in relation to social meaning and
action. These two faces of science are equally important. So my answer is
yes to questions 2 and 3 also.

**************************************************************

Somewhere, buried in the awesome complexity of Nature, lies the truth.
It is the task of science to disclose that truth, and the scientific method --
essentially edging forward by experimentation guided by and guiding
theorizing -- appers to be the most reliable mode of discovery. 
It may also be the only method of reliable discovery, but that we shall
probably never be able to test. There have certainly been other claimants
to the possession of modes of discovering the truth, and some are with us
still. They include religions, where the mode is personal revelation allied
with social coercion, and meditation, which is an inward form of religion
without the component of social coercion. Religion is definitely socially
conditioned, and its manifest failure to elucidate, as distinct from its
seemingly infinite power to confuse, could perhaps be construed as an
indication of the dangers that lie in wait for &quot;socially constructed&quot; modes
of discovering information. How can we be confident that science is
independent of society? First, there are the superficial indications.
Specifically, scientific conclusions -- its laws (its summaries of experience)
and its theories (its rationalization and revelation of interconnection) -- are
seemingly universal. Laws and theories, provided they are substantiated,
are accepted worldwide in cultures of endless variety, in societies with
different religions, political systems, personal deportments, and histories.
There is no Second Law for Christians and another Second Law for
Moslems; there is no General Relativity for Shintoists and another General
Relativity for Voodoo-ists. 
It might be argued that the Behemoth of Western science has trampled
underfoot the green shoots of alternative science, but there is not one iota
of experimental evidence for this view and every reason to believe that
those who hold it are motivated by jealousy in one of its disguises (such
as political correctness) or by a wish to see science&apos;s progress tripped.
That science is so successful at elucidation both trans-culturally and trans-
nationally is a first clear indication that it is not a social construct. 
Second, although societies change, sometimes by revolution and sometimes
regressively, science evolves smoothly and progressively. There is in fact,
no such thing as a total scientific revolution. Even those paradigms of
purported revolution, quantum theory and relativity, can, from our current
perspective, be seen to be elaborations of classical physics, for they
preserve much of its concepts, procedures, and attitudes. Science proceeds
by progressive, never regressive, evolution, gradually accreting information
and concepts that jointly enable its web to be extended. True, concepts are
discarded as they are found to be unnecessary, inappropriate, or
misleading; but their discarding is based on experimental evidence or
theoretical argument, not on political, legal, or social expediency. It is
noteworthy that the development of the theory of natural selection during
the 19th century effectively demolished the authority of the establishment
within which the theory had emerged. Truth will out despite the
consequences and despite the social milieu.
Third, science constitutes a network that has been built by investigations
in a wide variety of fields. Our current science springs from observation
as diverse as the abstract remoteness of the interpretation of tracks
recorded at CERN to the physical remoteness of monitoring sea-slugs in
Peru. Yet, despite the variety, both intellectually and socially, of these
sources, where they impinge on one another they invariably augment. If
science were a social construct, one would expect concepts and
observations that emerge from disparate sources and disciplines to clash.
Yet they invariably slot together like a key into a well-oiled lock.
Fourth, the pinnacle of scientific explanation is to be found in
mathematics. It is certainly true that not all scientific concepts are to be
found expressed mathematically, and some theories of high science, such
as the theory of evolution by natural selection, can be expressed without
it. Nevertheless, it is certainly true that fundamental ideas touching on the
deep structure of the Universe, the nature of elementary particles, the
nature of spacetime, cosmogenesis, motion, and in due course perhaps the
attributes of consciousness, can be expressed only in terms of mathematics.
Mathematics is aloof from being a social construct, being essentially a
distillation of the logic of relationships and utterly dry of any drips of
sentiment. It is thus hard to see how it can be maintained, if the deepest
results of science are discovered and expressed in a language that is so
utterly remote from sociological aspects of society, that the knowledge so
obtained is a social construct.
The universal character of science, by which I mean its independence of
lasting national, racial, religious, and political influences, must argue
strongly against the view that it is a social construct. Even if one social
group were so to dominate the landscape of scientific achievement, any
conscious conspiracy of silence would soon be exposed. The sociology of
science is such that scientists are desperate to discover: their reputation and 
funding -- their professional lives -- depend on it. If a scientist has a 
whiff of a discovery, then he will pursue it to the ends of the Earth partly
for the pure joy of exposing a hitherto unknown continent or even tiny
island of knowledge, but partly for the sake of self-advancement and a
 species of immortality. Regions of the unknown simply cannot remain
hidden under the onslaught of the activities of this refinement of market
forces. 
Of course, it could be argued that there are regions of knowledge that are
so in conflict with current paradigms that there is an unconscious
conspiracy of silence: the paranormal is an example. However, for all such
heresies there is virtually no sound evidence. Heretical &quot;observations&quot; are
all unrepeatable, contrived, or explicable by some adaptation of
conventional science. Unlike true science, which is a progression founded
in a globally coherent theoretical structure, the paranormal pseudosciences 
are speculative islands unsupported by any theoretical framework that
meshes into accepted and verified observations. The only sociology of
science involved in their exclusion from the pantheon of true science is
contempt for the evidence and scpticism of the power of free-form
speculation without the discipline and rigour of coherence within the
otherwise globally accepted paradigm.. in other words, the paranormal is
almost certainly speculative rubbish.
If science were a social construct, it would be hard to see how so much of
modern technology could work. The whole of the ubiquitous electronics
industry relies on quantum theory and a knowledge of materials that draws
on the deep principles of conventional science. It is simply absurd to
suppose that the development of technology is part of a conspiracy, even
an unconscious one. The same is equally true of the foundations of life and
the cautiously emerging industry based on genetic engineering and hence 
ultimately on molecular biology. 
The wonder of science is that it is a union (not a Mafia) of minds. Far
from being locally cohesive but globally exclusive, like religion and other
socially constructed codes, science is globally inclusive. Regardless of
background, a scientist can enter the sociological framework of science
provided he maintains the standards of integrity that (apart from a few
soon-exposed warts) generally characterize the activity, and adopts the
procedure of public experimentation that is science&apos;s principal route to
knowledge.
Why, though, do some people hope that science is a social construct? In
the main, I suspect, they are a subset of those who fear the achievements
of science in exposing the unsentimental core of the world. Moreover, it
is inevitable that practitioners of a particular cause are likely to consider
their discipline more royal than another, and to justify this view by seeking
to undermine what is widely regarded as superior. Social scientists, I
suspect, are not immune to this disease, as true scientists (as this article
reveals) are not also. However, science has much to show, whereas social
science does not.
Although the sociology of science is worthless epistemologically, it can
illuminate its procedures. Science is certainly a social activity, and hence
it is subject to the dynamics that attend any tribal association. There are
cautious revolutions, dominant and submissive members; there is crime and
there is politics. All this is a proper and worthwhile object of investigation,
and in certain respects social scientists are well equipped to contribute.
They are also entirely within their rights to probe the
authority of science and to invite scientists to reflect on the nature of their
activity. But they have virtually nothing to contribute to the pursuit of
science itself, which is best left to that most effective and constructive
group of human beings, the scientists themselves.

The question of the impact of the sociology of science on science looks all
too likely to be framed by the debate between biologist Lewis Wolpert and
sociologist Harry Collins at the British Association. This poses a problem
 for observers, for each holds a very particular epistemological stance
which is by no means generically held by other members of their
disciplines. 

Thus as we saw from the debate Lewis takes a realist view of science
whereas Harry takes a relativistic view -- the point being that it is entirely
possible to take a social constructionist view, as most social scientists do,
without taking issue with the truth claims of science. Some do, some do
not, and some regard their own accounts reflexively. However, it is
precisely at this moment that the essentially macho debate begins, for both
Harry and Lewis believe that what they say about the sociology of science
is unequivocally &quot;true&quot;. For Lewis this seems to be a sort of spill over
from the claims of certainty of the experimental sciences. For Harry, while
natural science is socially constructed
 and has only relativistic truth, his own sociological account of science
calims truth. With both Harry and Lewis being &quot;right&quot; we get an exchange
which tells us more about constructions of academic masculinity than how
much science and the sociology of science can learn from one another.
Pass please.

Date: Thu, 06 Oct 1994 11:57:39
From: aeweiss@mtu.edu (Andrew Weiss)
To: SCI-TECH-STUDIES@UCSD.EDU
Subject: Gross&apos;s response to Weiss

STS-Oct-M33-Weiss
Thanks to Gross for his reasoned reply to my posting (and thanks to those
with far more expertise than I who followed up).  However, I think Gross
missed a number of my points (and perhaps my embellished rhetoric interfered
with my message, for which I won&apos;t apologize).  First, I did not mean to
imply that technoscience (for lack of a better word) was THE CAUSE of
overpopulation and world travel, merely a vital contributor.  The extension
of this position (illustrated by Marks), is to ask if there is something in
the nature of technoscience or in the manner in which it is practiced that
leads it to often exacerbate the very problems it seeks to ameliorate? 
Iatrogenesis is but one example; another is military technology (do better
weapons bring more or less national security and global conflict?).  I&apos;m not
saying this is a black-or-white issue, but that there are enough instances
of technoscience better serving the needs of its practitioners and its
powerful patrons than the needs of ordinary people, that the institution
deserves critical scrutiny of a fundamental nature.

Gross later asks why STSers don&apos;t apply for guidance on what to study.  I&apos;m
not against this, and I think it would probably be useful.  But I&apos;m not
going to start pushing for it relentlessly until we begin to get hundreds of
millions of dollars to pursue our research and until the fruits of our study
show the potential to change the ways people live their lives.  I do, by the
way, think their is a clear strain of fear-of-the-people (or fear of
democracy) in technoscientists (see, for example, Fischer, _Technocracy and
the Politics of Expertise_, Sage 1990).

Finally, the only alternative to having agendas set by the experts is not
having it set by members of Congress according to their own, often
parochical, agendas.  Another alternative is reasoned public debate. 
Farfetched perhaps, but primarily because none of the parties are adequately
prepared for it.  The general awareness of the transformatory power and
limitations of technoscience, as well as the tentative nature of many
knowledge claims, is poor among the public, the experts, and policy makers. 
In my humble opinion, the best of STS is what seeks to address this problem.
And it is not a problem that will be solved quickly, or that can be solved
by the cogitation of academics.  It will take political conflict and
negotiation, social learning, and deliberate experimentation.  We will have
to muddle through it, which is not the same thing as proceeding in a
muddleheaded manner.  We can muddle intelligently, deliberately, and with
respect for the inevitably differing positions various stakeholders.  We may
not find THE ANSWER (in fact, I think answers are overrated), but we at
least will be talking to and not past each other (cf. Stone, _Policy Paradox
and Political Reason_, HarperCollins 1988).</segment>

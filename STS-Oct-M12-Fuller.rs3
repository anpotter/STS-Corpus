On the National Association of Scholars (NAS): Reply to MORMAN</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="20" relname="span">

Maybe Paul Gross or someone else who has direct involvement with this 
group will want to intervene</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="concession"> (though few probably pay attention to this 
net),</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="30" relname="span"> but I will give you the history of NAS from the standpoint of 
someone who is on the governing board of the group that was formed in 
opposition to NAS: Teachers for a Democratic Culture (TDC).</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="22" relname="span"> I should say 
at the outset that I believe both NAS and TDC are dominated by humanists, </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="5" relname="elaboration">
and their battles are typically over political correctness and what (if 
any) are the canonical books of Western civilization.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="22" relname="concession"> However, a notable 
sociologist who is a member of NAS is James Coleman, rational choice 
theorist and past president of the American Sociological Association. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="22" relname="concession">
Some natural scientists are members of NAS, but are still very much in 
the minority.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="25" relname="span">

I think NAS was started as a direct result of the stuff on political
correctness being reported in such US best-sellers as Allan Bloom&apos;s _The
closing of the American mind_ and Dinesh D&apos;Souza&apos;s book (whose name
escapes me).</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="23" relname="span"> The basic idea was that America&apos;s classrooms were being
dominated by irresponsible relativists and multiculturalists who were
passing off political agendas as if they were established truths.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="9" relname="elaboration"> The NAS 
vowed to combat this scourge that was being held responsible for various 
forms of national decline. </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="26" relname="span">

The NAS actually has some noted scholars on its board -- including the
redoubtable philosopher John Searle -- who I don&apos;t think would normally
count as political reactionaries.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="concession"> (True, they&apos;re not exactly socialists,
either.)</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="27" relname="span"> I believe at one point the NAS supported the idea of students 
monitoring classrooms for unduly political behavior on the part of 
professors and then reporting it to some lobbying group that would then kick 
up a fuss.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration"> Certainly such matters are discussed in a journal NAS puts 
out, called ACADEMIC QUESTIONS. </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="28" relname="span">

The group I belong to -- TDC -- responded by declaring that the classroom 
is a perfectly good place to air differences of opinion, which if strong 
enough typically acquire the label &apos;political&apos;.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="background"> Gerald Graff, the English 
professor at Univ of Chicago, founded the TDC and wrote several articles 
and a book around the idea of &apos;teaching the conflicts&apos;. </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="29" relname="span">

Science is really a newcomer to this whole debate,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="concession"> though the themes 
of deconstruction and &apos;the end of civilization as we know it&apos; remain the 
same.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="4" relname="elaboration"> Actually, the last chapter of Gross &amp; Levitt&apos;s _Higher 
Superstition_ considers the teaching angle very explicitly, and in so 
doing, put science studies very much in the middle of a debate that had 
previously concerned only humanists.</segment>

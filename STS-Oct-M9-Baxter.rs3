    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="preparation">Dear STSers,</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="25" relname="span">

Although I haven&apos;t been following these &apos;anti-anti-science&apos; diatribes very
closely,</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="19" relname="span"> I did develop an early distaste for Lewis Wolpert&apos;s brand of science
hagiography</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="circumstance"> when I saw him on television last year in discussion with
Mary Midgeley and others. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="6" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> And from reading some of the postings on this list,
I had become aware that an increasing number of scientists and others had 
become engaged in formulating similar anti-sts discourses.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="23" relname="span">
So, I was pleasantly suprised</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="14" relname="span"> when, during an STS summer school in the
Netherlands a few weeks ago, I met a couple of people who were involved in an
interdisciplinary project called &apos;towards non-linear optics&apos;. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="18" relname="span"> As well as the
usual scientific disciplines (chemical physics, micro electronics, solid state
physics etc.), the list of cooperating departments included a group from
_Sociology of Science_.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="volitional-cause">
The official rationale for including this group was apparently of the &apos;greasing
the wheels of scientific communication&apos; variety, which sometimes put them
in a slightly difficult position,</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="6" relname="elaboration"> but what struck me was the way that something
which (I would guess) would be quite unimaginable in the British context was
happening there in a fairly unproblematic way.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="24" relname="span">
Some questions:</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="20" relname="list"> Does anyone know how common this kind of thing actually is, and
whether it does happen &apos;over here&apos;? </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="22" relname="span"> What do people think about the virtues and
vices of involvement in this sort of project? </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="13" relname="elaboration"> (To what extent should we allow the
criterion for good work in STS to become that members of the scientific comm-
unity consider us to have helped them?) </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="condition"> If some kind of cultural difference
can be articulated,</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="21" relname="span"> does anyone want to speculate on its causes and significance?</segment>

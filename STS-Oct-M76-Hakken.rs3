&amp;gt; I doubt that a much better reception would be forthcoming to
&amp;gt; people who produce &quot;thick&quot; descriptions, such as Karin Knorr-
&amp;gt; Cetina. You can&apos;t quite repair the damage done to the
&amp;gt; &quot;specialness&quot; of science by saying that aspects of science
&amp;gt; resemble a myriad of non-scientific practices. By comparison,
&amp;gt; even the most carefully wrought anthropology of religion is bound
&amp;gt; to provide some offense to the True Believer, since the
&amp;gt; anthropologist has made a methodological decision not to take
&amp;gt; professions of faith as self-explanatory. </segment>

Further, 
&amp;gt; The tough question -- which EDWARDS hasn&apos;t really
&amp;gt; addressed -- is how much authority you grant those opinions in
&amp;gt; directing the course of your own narrative. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="40" relname="span">

The only way to address this question is through some
sort of dialogue with technoscientists.</segment>

Thus, the backlash leaves us little room to avoid incorporating 
another phase of activity, a moment after criticism.</segment>

&amp;gt; science studies IS anti-something-about-science. What
&amp;gt; that something is, however, is rarely made clear in our work --
&amp;gt; in part because it&apos;s probably different things for different
&amp;gt; people. But it&apos;s got to be made more explicit. </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="33" relname="span">

We can&apos;t have a constructive dialogue without being clear on the basis of
our criticism. </segment>

practice distorted by the Modernist project.  </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="31" relname="span">

Further, our ability to
engage in dialogue with scientist and technologists depends upon our
showing how a reconstruction on non-modernist lines is possible.</segment>

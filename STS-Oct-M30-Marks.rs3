&amp;gt; Response:  WHATEVER caused the rate of human population growth to
&amp;gt; attain its current value, and made mass air transport possible,
&amp;gt; we have both of them NOW.  A third-world nation (with a deep
&amp;gt; commitment to &quot;technoscience&quot; and thousands of intelligent people
&amp;gt; doing it) has just--last week--turned to pathology, public
&amp;gt; health, and sanitary engineering to stop in its tracks (it is
&amp;gt; hoped!) a threatened pandemic of pneumonic plague.  It even made
&amp;gt; the papers. </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="40" relname="span"> 
        In 1882, Robert Koch publishing a path breaking paper in which he 
identified the tubercle bacillus as the cause of tuberculosis.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="5" relname="antithesis">  The paper 
was pathbreaking not only because it identified the agent reponsible for 
the [then] leading cause of death,</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="37" relname="span"> but because it laid out a set of 
protocols for what would constiute proof of causality in such matters. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration">
Along with the exquisite techniques developed by Koch, these protocols 
led 12 years later to the identification of yersina pestis as the 
causative organism in bubonic plague.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="38" relname="span">
        At the end of his article (which I happened to be teaching 
yesterday), Koch&apos;s says, in effect, it was previously thought that social 
ills were the cause of tuberculosis. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="7" relname="elaboration"> I have now shown that we don&apos;t have

    <segment id="10" parent="44" relname="antithesis">
        Gross says that what happened in India last week is to the credit 
of our science, which is essentially, in these matters, Koch&apos;s science.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="43" relname="background"> I
agree:</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="41" relname="span"> the toll would have been far worse were we not living in this age </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="concession">
[though what part of our advantage lies in knowledge and technique, and 
what part in social organization is a question over which historians of 
medicine still disagree.]</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="42" relname="span">  But, I would suggest, if we give 
Koch/science the credit,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="43" relname="span"> we must also ask whether Koch/science do not 
have a share of the blame:</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="39" relname="span"> that is, there is no reason for that epidemic 
to have happened at all,</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="elaboration"> and Koch was one of the people who historically 
turned our backs [in the name of science] to the necessity for dealing with 
the social conditions which led quite directly to the outbreak of the 
epidemic.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="46" relname="background">
        I have been in enough of these discussions to anticipate two of 
the responses:</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="46" relname="list"> 1) Science cannot be held responsible for all the social 
ills of the world;</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="46" relname="list"> 2) I, am, personally a liberal, and agree that what 
happened should not have happened.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="48" relname="span">
        My response would be that science [e.g. scientists] cannot at one 
and same time take credit for curing/obviating social ills and then place 
all responsibility for social ills on the politicians and/or the 
political process. </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="23" relname="antithesis"> 
 The last major programs supporting only science Good
&amp;gt; for the People, after WWII, and banning science Not Good for the
&amp;gt; People, were in Stalin&apos;s Soviet Union and Mao&apos;s China.  The
&amp;gt; People didn&apos;t get much Good.
&amp;gt;      </segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="56" relname="span"> Actually, I though the last [.e.g most recent] programs vending 
science in the name of the nation came from R.M. Nixon [the war on 
cancer]; and prior to that Eisenhower [the space program] and Truman [the 
atomic program]. </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="25" relname="concession"> While the lst and 2nd of these may have led to some 
beautiful science,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="57" relname="span"> let&apos;s not forget some ofthe other things all three led 
to. </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="49" relname="evidence"> So far as the Soviets are concerned, there is a good deal of work 
being done by historians east of the Urals on Soviet Science,</segment>

different [e.g. more centralized],</segment>

the 1950s. </segment>

&amp;gt; Response:  A grudging and vigilant contract with elitism is what
&amp;gt; we have NOW.  Maybe Weiss thinks it should be MORE grudging and
&amp;gt; vigilant.  OK.  No argument.  Maybe also more informed.  The
&amp;gt; distortion is to suggest that all politicians (who are supposed
&amp;gt; to represent the public, after all) have signed a contract that
&amp;gt; has NO vigilance or grudges.  Anybody who believes that has not,
&amp;gt; again, been reading the papers.  Are scientists afraid of the
&amp;gt; people?  No: they ARE the people, or a part of it, as are
&amp;gt; professors of STS.  Why do not the latter apply for guidance on
&amp;gt; _what_ to study?  (Some) scientists (I hope) ARE afraid of
&amp;gt; referenda on WHAT and HOW.  Some are old enough to remember the
&amp;gt; consternation and waste that followed, many years ago, the demand
&amp;gt; from an influential Congressman, speaking, presumably, for his
&amp;gt; constituents, that the NIH immediately deploy major resources in
&amp;gt; an attack upon Athlete&apos;s Foot.</segment>

        One does not have to look to science policy to see evidence of waste

    <segment id="33" parent="34" relname="condition"> and if Prof. Gross prefers it as well,</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="50" relname="span"> I think the appropriate

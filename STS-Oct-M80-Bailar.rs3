    <segment id="2" parent="19" relname="span">

&quot;It&apos;s not that hard to open up space for scientists to voice 
their opinions in science studies narratives. In fact, this is
routinely done. The tough question -- which EDWARDS hasn&apos;t really
addressed -- is how much authority you grant those opinions in
directing the course of your own narrative. Usually, this
question is answered by simply not addressing your narrative to
scientists (or hoping they don&apos;t read you!). In that case,
scientists&apos; words are quickly converted to symptoms (or &apos;signs&apos;,
if one is a bit more neutral). But scientists are now beginning
to take our stuff seriously, and so this particular form of
evasion is not going to work much longer.&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="31" relname="span">

But I&apos;m not sure that opening up space for scientists will be
enough. </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="30" relname="span"> They will need to see some reason to become engaged.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="23" relname="span">
And this brings me back to my original question, restated a few
weeks ago here, about the ultimate purposes of our work (as
well as theirs). </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> Can we help them produce a strain of rice
with a higher yield, or come up with the Grand Unified Theory
of physics, or reduce human suffering from cancer, or anything
else they may care about? </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> Conversely, can we show that their
talents would be better invested in some other approach to the
elucidation of natural phenomena, or that their meritocratic
approach to the big decisions of science is sub- optimal in
some way not yet defined, or that society would be better
served if science were harnessed more directly to political
objectives? </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="20" relname="span"> Plug in your own favored questions here</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="elaboration"> -- the
point is that the working scientist is unlikely to become
engaged unless you show him/her, in clear terms, that such
engagement may matter.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="24" relname="span">  One approach that will get their
attention is, of course, the threat that science will be
marginalized,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="21" relname="span"> but is that what we want? </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="25" relname="span"> If not, </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="27" relname="span">what DO we 
want, and why, and how can we get there?</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="15" relname="span">

Am I too ill-informed, or too slow to pick up on things, or 
otherwise behind the rest of you? </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration"> Or would I be correct in 
concluding that we have little to offer, whether to the 
scientist or the public? </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="26" relname="solutionhood"> Is there reason to think that we will 
have more to offer in the future? </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="concession"> (My own answers would be No, 
Yes, nsd Yes,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="26" relname="span"> but maybe some of you have other answers.)</segment>

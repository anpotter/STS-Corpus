Now that things have subsided a bit,</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="99" relname="span"> I thought I&apos;d throw in my 2 cent&apos;s
worth. </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="91" relname="span"> I&apos;m not going to worry about attributing embedded ideas to
particular people,</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="otherwise"> otherwise I&apos;d need a wall chart to keep them straight. 
No slights intended. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="93" relname="span">

We do seem to be at a crossroads in terms of society&apos;s relationship with
science and technology</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="100" relname="span"> and I think it is this larger instability (if that&apos;s
the right word) which has helped raise the prominence of STS. </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="54" relname="circumstance"> (When I was
working for IBM as a summer intern some years ago,</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="54" relname="contrast"> my fellow interns and I
decided that prominence resulting from something good was &quot;visibility&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="54" relname="contrast">
while prominence resulting from a screw up constituted &quot;exposure.&quot; </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="58" relname="elaboration"> You can
decide for yourselves which term is most applicable to STS!)</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="61" relname="span">  This has
certainly been the case in Britain which over the last few years has seen
the publication of several popular critiques of science and technology
(both good and not so good) and a number of television programs including
in particular a series called Pandora&apos;s Box.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="56" relname="span">  C.P. Snow has been called
into service</segment>
    <segment id="55" parent="12" relname="volitional-cause"> as talk of the two cultures once again has become fashionable.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="62" relname="span">
 The end of the Cold War has clearly contributed to this trend as defense
decreases in importance as a driver of science and technology</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> (although
judging from what I&apos;m hearing of the election results in the States,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="57" relname="span"> this
may be about to change there). </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="60" relname="elaboration"> And of course, there&apos;s the general ruckus
surrounding multiculturalism and other perceived threats arising out of
&quot;political corrrectness.&quot; </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="101" relname="nonvolitional-cause">

I suppose because science is more heavily dependent than technology on
government funding,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="101" relname="span"> scientists are especially worried about their future
funding fortunes in the wake of all this instability</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="18" relname="background"> (I suspect the
cancellation of the superconducting supercollider really sounded the
alarm). </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="64" relname="condition"> Well, if you need to rally the troops and circle the wagons</segment>
    <segment id="64" parent="65" relname="span"> it
helps to have a well defined enemy,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="102" relname="span"> and it seems that a segment of the
scientific community has latched onto STS as the chief villain. </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="67" relname="span"> Of course,
in order to do this effectively they have to focus on the more radical (and
thus readily identifiable as threatening) parts of what we&apos;re all aware is
an extremely heterogeneous STS universe.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="69" relname="span">  In this sense, it&apos;s to their
advantage to keep the debate polarized;</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="66" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> once you acknowledge the diversity
of STS</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="66" relname="span"> the perceived threat level can&apos;t help but go down</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="25" relname="elaboration"> and it becomes
much more difficult to use STS as a way of framing the case for support and
protection of science. </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="28" relname="antithesis"> I don&apos;t mean to suggest by this phrasing that I
think all or most scientists are acting in a self-consciously cynical
fashion. </segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="73" relname="span"> Rather, I think this is for the most part a logical albeit
unfortunate reaction to a disturbing period of instability.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="30" relname="antithesis">

Therefore, I don&apos;t see much to be gained from spending a lot of time and
effort trying to refute the various misperceptions and ill-founded
criticisms. </segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="103" relname="span"> Instead, I think STS needs to concentrate on presenting itself
as a means of usefully addressing important kinds of issues of concern to a
great many people. </segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="75" relname="span"> 
Even those STS scholars whose principal interests are purely theoretical
have a stake in this</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="31" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> inasmuch as they&apos;re dependent on the perceived
legitimacy  of the STS enterprise which attracts the funds which supports
their work.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="76" relname="span">  And it is up to all of us to show how the most radical (and
flak generating) stuff plays a necessary role in a living, breathing STS
enterprise,</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="33" relname="concession"> even when we don&apos;t personally agree with it (as in any other
field of intellectual inquiry for that matter). </segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="80" relname="span">

One thing that greatly disturbs me is the inclination that some STS
scholars have shown to react by simply withdrawing from the fray.</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="37" relname="concession">  While I
can understand their frustration with trying to get through to people they
see as unremittingly hostile and willfully obtuse,</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="78" relname="span"> I think it is ultimately
self-defeating to simply cede the stage.</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="81" relname="span">  In addition to those who will
never be amenable to anything more critical than traditional history and
philosophy of science, I firmly believe there exists a large proportion of
scientists and engineers who are open to the idea that STS in its myriad
variations can be a force for positive change and accomplishment.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="40" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  In the
absence of a _positive_ (but nonetheless critical) vision put strongly
forward by the STS community,</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="79" relname="span"> the only coherent argument they hear will
come from the demonizers of STS. </segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="82" relname="span"> I want to stress, though, that a positive
vision of STS would most definitely include acknowledgement of and response
to those criticisms of STS which do strike a chord.</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="41" relname="elaboration">  Dialogue (in its many
different forms) is an essential part of such a vision. </segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="84" relname="span">

Where and how to do this is of course a key question</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="43" relname="elaboration"> and I think it&apos;s quite
right that little is gained by addressing ourselves to the faithful. </segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="85" relname="list"> Many
more of us (and I&apos;m as guilty as anyone of not doing this enough) need to
write for both the popular press and those organs aimed at the chattering
classes (as they are referred to over here) such as the Economist and the
New Republic. </segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="85" relname="list"> More of us should also be in various experts databases which
the media use.</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="85" relname="list">  And we all need to make our presence felt at public
hearings on issues concerning science and technology. </segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="86" relname="span"> In doing all of
this, though, even when being critical, we need to project an air of
reasonableness. </segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="48" relname="motivation"> After all, that is the heart of the argument against us,
that we are being unreasonable in our criticisms of scientists and
technologists and that we are somehow urging the abandonment of reason by
them. </segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="51" relname="antithesis"> Instead of spending a lot of time and effort trying to demonstrate
why we&apos;re not bad,</segment>
    <segment id="51" parent="87" relname="span"> let&apos;s focus on showing why and how we&apos;re good.  </segment>
    <segment id="52" parent="53" relname="concession">

This is all terribly banal, I know,</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="90" relname="span"> but growing up in the American midwest
does that to you.</segment>

No need to be theoretical -</segment>

Not only that, but to at least a limited extent, they have had the benefit,
such as it is, of an STS-type approach for quite a while. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="justify"> I have been
a contractor for technology development and technology assessment to these
and other agencies with programs in this area, for more than ten years,
and have sought to bring STS-informed methodologies to bear in
several areas, which in summary, seek to bring the social knowledge resident
in communities of persons with disabilities into the technology development
process in order to enhance the liklihood that resulting protoypes will
meet real needs of real people and to reduce the risk of innovation.</segment>

Anyway, I am finishing a study of the developmet and innovation

1943,</segment>

of assistive technologies.</segment>

By the way, the continuing interaction of defense-sponsored research
and the development of assistive technologies makes for a complex
and fascinating story in itself.</segment>

work was sponsored by Vannevar Bush (personally) and the OSRD, and
that the research leading to the first commercial reading machine
for the blind (the Optacon around 1971) was performed by a team
at Stanford U. whose major funding through 1967 came from the
Navy and the Air Force.</segment>

One of my hopes and a high item on my personal STS agenda is to influence
technology developers in this and other fields to employ STS-generated

I have noticed a curious undertone to this debate concerning the 
attacks on STS/SSK. </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="4" relname="antithesis"> The claim has been put forward that scientists 
are wrong to think that they are under attack by the SSK folks.  </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="2" relname="span">
Rather, what is being criticized is philosophy of science. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="44" relname="evidence"> 

For example, Fuller (I think -- apologies if I have got the wrong 
person) quoted Latour to the effect that philosophers of science were 
whores and strumpets -- as though they are sirens on the street-
corners of the academy, luring impressionable scientists away for 
immoral purposes.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="32" relname="span">  Bernie Lieberman seems to have tendencies in this 
direction.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="8" relname="antithesis">  He talks of fusion gangs, collider gangs, and genome 
gangs. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="31" relname="span"> But when these neighborhood toughs (or their advocates) 
take him to task he says words to the effect,</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="10" relname="solutionhood"> &quot;What? You guys? </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="29" relname="span"> 
I didn&apos;t mean you,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="30" relname="span"> I meant &quot;Shorty&quot; over there</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration"> -- the philosopher of 
science (with all his stories about the nature of science)&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="45" relname="span">

Here is my concern:</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="46" relname="span"> I don&apos;t know that it makes much sense to conceive 
of science in such a way that you can make a straightforward &quot;cut&quot; 
between science and philosophy of science</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="35" relname="span"> (and be careful of general 
arguments here</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="33" relname="span"> -- there are several species of philosophy of science, </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="34" relname="span">
and within most species, there is much intra-specific variation -- </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="elaboration">
this in itself creates a space for hasty generalizations about 
philosophers of science, and their wicked ways).</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="37" relname="span">  

I do not believe that you can simply carve science out of the 
intellectual (including philosophical) environment in which it takes 
place -- certainly in any such way that would allow you to sharply 
differentiate &quot;the science&quot; from the &quot;stories about the science&quot;. </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="36" relname="span"> To 
pursue a Quinean metaphor, the science and the stories are 
constitutive of the &quot;web of belief&quot;,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="elaboration"> and the parts are made sense of 
from the perspective of the whole.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="23" relname="concession">

Certainly there is much more to science -- even theoretical science --
 than philosophy of science.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="43" relname="span">  But it also seems to be true to say 
that philosophy of science has -- in its many guises -- helped to 
shape science, and scientific debates in particular.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="38" relname="preparation">  Examples:</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="41" relname="span"> the 
influence of positivism on the formation of special relativity </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="40" relname="elaboration">
(e.g., Einstein&apos;s interpretation of the null result of the 
Michelson-Morley experiment,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="40" relname="elaboration"> and his rejection of the realism of 
FitzGerald and Lorentz),</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="42" relname="span"> and general relativity</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="27" relname="elaboration"> (e.g., the formulation 
of the principle of equivalence)</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="38" relname="list"> -- not to mention the quantum

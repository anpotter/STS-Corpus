My musings after reading this thread for several weeks:</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="106" relname="span">

I am not surprised by the backlash.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="65" relname="span">  STS challenges the knowledge and
truth claims and the authority of the various technoscience communities.  </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration">
You only have to read the postings to this mail list to learn how people 
react to such challenges.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="107" relname="span">

Nor should we be surprised that they object to readings that take a
stance of agnosticism to the existence of the reality that the technoscience
practicianers pursue.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="evidence">  What would a ship captain make of an account of
his/her actions that ignored the sea? </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="109" relname="background"> I take the various
techno-scientific systems as heterogeneous systems in the sense
employed by Hughes and Law. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="condition"> If it is an advance to study technology
as deeply embedded in social and physical systems,</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="109" relname="span"> what to make of a
analytic stance that begins by discarding one of the components of the
system? </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="111" relname="summary"> The perception that sts does this will certainly alarm many.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="73" relname="span">

The mechanism underlying the backlash is nothing more, nothing less
than the territorial instinct of our species. </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> STS encroaches on the
intellectual territory of technoscience,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="69" relname="span"> and the counter-attack
follows. </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="66" relname="sequence"> Add in the inter-tribal rivalry of the hard-science clan and
the humanities clan as a factor. </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="66" relname="sequence"> Step back and see what happens.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="19" relname="volitional-cause">
Imagine a telecommunications engineer analyzes the work of the latest
post-modern literary critic</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="68" relname="span"> and concludes that the critic is not
communicating</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="67" relname="span"> because he/she is actually increasing uncertainty,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="nonvolitional-result"> so
the information content is negative. </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="68" relname="nonvolitional-result"> Will verbal feathers fly? </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="concession"> Well, 
yes, the analogy is a bit loose,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="74" relname="span"> but someone who feels threatened
doesn&apos;t worry about the details. </segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="24" relname="antithesis"> Also note that these musings are not
to be read as rigorous analysis or depiction on the issues;</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="76" relname="span"> indeed,
it takes one version of STS for the whole enterprise, as much of the
backlash does.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="121" relname="span">

How to react to the backlash? </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="27" relname="condition"> Well, if the backlash is territorial
defense, </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="78" relname="span">then it seems we may have three options:</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="85" relname="span">

1)  Back off.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="80" relname="solutionhood">  Not likely, huh? </segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="79" relname="concession"> Maybe not complete disengagement,</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="32" relname="antithesis"> but
conceding that indeed, technoscience has not achieved perfection,</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="79" relname="span"> but
it is a way of producing truth claims that increasingly approach
validity, and describing the social/political/economic components of
the technoscience communities.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="83" relname="span">

2)  Make displays of submission.</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="33" relname="elaboration">  &quot;We&apos;re here to serve you--show you
how to better educate the next generation, how the policy and funding
games work so you can play them better, how to communicate to the public.&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="84" relname="span">

3)  Go for the throat. </segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="82" relname="span"> Establish that the technoscience communities
are deluded and deluding about the nature of the whole enterprise;</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="36" relname="elaboration"> it
is a product of political-economy and social structure and language games.</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="88" relname="span">

Well, maybe there is another way, which works by avoiings the oppositional
positioning of two essentialized communities. </segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="87" relname="span"> Keep our boundaries
permeable,</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="39" relname="elaboration"> open to sharing ideas and communications with the other.</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="117" relname="span">
Avoid the rhetorical games often used to stake territorial claims.  </segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="43" relname="preparation">

EG:</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="116" relname="span">
just having read Delaporte&apos;s &quot;Disease and Civilization&quot;,</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="113" relname="span"> he begins by
issuing a challenge:</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="46" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> &quot;I assert, to begin with, that &quot;disease&quot; does not
exist. </segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="90" relname="span"> It is therefore illusory to think that one can &quot;develop
beliefs&quot; about it or &quot;respond&quot; to it. </segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="91" relname="span"> What does exist is not disease
but practices.&quot; </segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="92" relname="interpretation"> The intention here is to shock, to throw down a
conceptual gauntlet. </segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="114" relname="span"> In the narrative that follows, I found nothing
that would throw off any medical-science practitioner,</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="94" relname="span"> but surely they
will be be put-off by the early claim that they have been devoting
their careers to something which doesn&apos;t exist. </segment>
    <segment id="51" parent="115" relname="span"> Delaporte could have
worked his way into his point gradually, showing how theories about
disease and society affected different conceptualizations of cholera
and responses to the epidemic of 1832, which he does, and offer his
dramatic climax at the end. </segment>
    <segment id="52" parent="105" relname="span"> There is a reason for his use of a
different rhetorical strategy, within the dynamics of the community of
constructivists and post-modernists he writes for:</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="54" relname="volitional-cause"> the more temples of
the past you can pull down around you,</segment>
    <segment id="54" parent="95" relname="span"> the greater your recognition.</segment>
    <segment id="55" parent="56" relname="concession">
(We&apos;re still writing out the Enlightenment belief in progress</segment>
    <segment id="56" parent="96" relname="span"> even as we
criticize it.) </segment>
    <segment id="57" parent="101" relname="span"> In the end, Delaporte has staked a territorial claim, 
challenging the prevailing medical-science community construction of 
&quot;disease&quot;, implicitly their ownership of the concept, their right to
construct it. </segment>
    <segment id="58" parent="100" relname="span"> But he was drawing on the discourse of the community;</segment>
    <segment id="59" parent="99" relname="span">
he reshaped and reframed familiar material,</segment>
    <segment id="98" parent="59" relname="antithesis"> rather than undercutting
the whole epistemological basis for their construction,</segment>
    <segment id="60" parent="102" relname="span"> and he could
have framed his argument in those terms, remained permeable to dialog
with community practitioners.  </segment>
    <segment id="61" parent="119" relname="span">

It seems to me in watching the dynamics of these oppositional debates
that usually the rhetoric that is heard most flows from the most
atagonistic factions of each camp. </segment>
    <segment id="62" parent="104" relname="span"> Boundaries are strengthened,</segment>
    <segment id="103" parent="62" relname="nonvolitional-result"> and
forging understandings across the lines harder. </segment>
    <segment id="63" parent="64" relname="antithesis"> Rather than
counter-attack the counter-attack (&quot;backlash&quot;),</segment>
    <segment id="64" parent="118" relname="span"> maybe we should offer
to buy a threatened scientist a beer and have a friendly chat (one of
my favorite ethnographic techniques!).</segment>

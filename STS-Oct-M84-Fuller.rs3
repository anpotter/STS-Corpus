    <segment id="1" parent="94" relname="preparation">Reply to VAN DER MEULEN</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="54" relname="antithesis">

First, it is easy to castigate the idea of &apos;criticism&apos; as a way of
communicating with scientists,</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="53" relname="concession"> but &apos;criticism&apos; has the rhetorical
advantage of making it clear that we&apos;re actually addressing scientists</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="54" relname="span">
yet, at the same time, we do not necessarily accept their goals as our
own.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="55" relname="background"> Science studies has a tendency to veer in one of two directions.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="57" relname="span"> On
the one hand, there are those who don&apos;t criticize scientists</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="5" relname="volitional-cause"> because
they&apos;re not talking to scientists but only to other (virtual?) science
studies practitioners.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="56" relname="span"> On the other hand, there are those who don&apos;t
criticize scientists</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="volitional-cause"> because they basically see themselves as helping
scientists accomplish their goals -- a bit like public relations people. </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="10" relname="purpose">
I see &apos;criticism&apos; as designed to avoid these two extremes,</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="59" relname="span"> so as to 
maintain an engaged independence. </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="58" relname="antithesis">

Moreover, I find it a bit disappointing that in the past few years,
several leaders in the field have tried to distance science studies from
science criticism.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="58" relname="span"> Scientists read the work as critical</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> because it IS
critical.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="concession">  Maybe some of our leaders feel uncomfortable with having to
face the kinds of questions that invariably hound people who are
identified as &apos;critics&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="84" relname="span"> but the damage has already been done,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="elaboration"> and we
should make the most of it.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="64" relname="span">  But having said all that, VAN DER MEULEN is
certainly right that criticism needs to be something more than mere
carping from the sidelines. </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="62" relname="span">The Dutch examples he cites are quite good.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="20" relname="purpose"> In
fact, it might pay to have cases of that kind put in a convenient place (a
booklet perhaps)</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="61" relname="span"> so that science studies practitioners in other countries
can demonstrate ways in which the field has been successfully fitted into
the state policy apparatus.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="62" relname="elaboration"> From the standpoint of the current discussion,
it would be interesting to hear whether some Dutch science studies
practitioners feel they&apos;re &apos;selling their souls&apos; by being so intimately
involved in policy issues. </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="87" relname="span">

On matters of democratization, I agree also that there are many ways to
go.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="background"> I raise several of them in my _Philosophy, Rhetoric, and the End of
KNowledge_ (Wisconsin 93).</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="88" relname="span"> With regard to US science policy, the big
problem with agenda setting is that there is no central clearing house for
science policy decisionmaking.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="65" relname="span"> Different agencies do their own thing,</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="66" relname="span"> and
the &apos;megaprojects&apos; (e.g. Supercollider, Human Genome, etc.) have most of
their budgets decided directly by Congress.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="26" relname="elaboration"> In Congress, e.g., scientific
projects often have to compete with non-scientific projects for the same
pool of funds, which is one way in which &apos;pork&apos; makes its presence felt.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="68" relname="span">
In an ideal world -- perhaps the Netherlands is such a place! -- all the
science-based projects would go through the same channels</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="28" relname="elaboration"> and we&apos;d be able
to compare them by whatever (democratic) criteria we like.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="67" relname="span"> STSers are
often quite good with criteria.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="70" relname="span"> Unfortunately, no such forum exists in the
US for such criteria to be tested or applied on a regular basis.</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="33" relname="antithesis">  The 1991
OTA Report, _Federally Funded Science: Decisions for a Decade_, hinted at
the need for more consolidation of the US science policy agenda.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="69" relname="span"> However,
short of restructuring the federal bureaucracy,</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="69" relname="evaluation"> I doubt that this will be 
coming soon. </segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="91" relname="span">

However, in my mind, the most realistic site for science democratization
is science education,</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="35" relname="elaboration"> where students get exposed to what it is to be a
scientist,</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="35" relname="elaboration"> how is science done,</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="35" relname="elaboration"> what is its significance,</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="35" relname="elaboration"> etc.</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="75" relname="span"> STS will
always have a hard time with senior scientists who often have rather fixed
ideas about the nature of science,</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="72" relname="span"> and may be unwilling to budge largely</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="74" relname="span">
because those ideas have helped them get ahead in science.</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="44" relname="antithesis"> (This is not to
say that no meeting of minds is possible with them</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="73" relname="span"> - it is just much
harder.)</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="79" relname="span"> However, there is a younger generation that is more uncertain
about the future and is therefore ready to consider alternative visions of
science.</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="77" relname="span"> For example, in the NOvember 94 _Social Studies of Science_,
Steven Weinberg and Lewis WOlpert respond to the review essay I did of
their books earlier this year.</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="76" relname="span"> In my reply to them, I cite a passage from
the recent ballot for council members in the American Physics Society.</segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="78" relname="span">
There were 4 write-in candidates who basically said that the physics
community had let its younger generation down by enticing them into
projects that have left them without jobs.</segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="48" relname="elaboration"> You can tell from their
statements that they are groping for some kind of social understanding of
science in which to frame their predicament.</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="79" relname="evaluation"> Here STS can make a big
contribution, it seems to me.

    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="preparation">I am going to respond to the following remarks by STEVE FULLER:</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="88" relname="span">
&amp;gt; 
 First off, SHANKS claims that philosophers of scinece don&apos;t see 
&amp;gt; themselves as underlaborers to scientists, but in fact several have 
&amp;gt; openly embraced this Lockean image.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="evaluation">

This is quite consistent with what I said. </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="92" relname="span"> All I was trying to 
suggest is that philosophers of science were legitimate participants, 
along with the scientists themselves (theoretical and experimental), 
in shared enterprises with (some) shared goals.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="87" relname="span">  I sense that some 
participants in this debate would like to &quot;down-size&quot; science</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration"> -- and 
as usual, the first to go are the underlaborers.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="8" relname="antithesis">

 In his book of interviews with 
&amp;gt; philosophers of science, Werner Callebaut observed this pattern very 
&amp;gt; strongly. Some guys, like Robert Brandon, made it very clear that  the 
&amp;gt; scientists set the agenda for philosophers of science (at least teh ones 
&amp;gt; he associates with). </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="93" relname="span">

The sense in which philosophers of science might legitimately be 
called underlaborers is the sense in which, if there was no science, 
there would be no philosophy of science. </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="91" relname="span"> The &quot;underlaborer&quot; image 
has other connotations. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="89" relname="span"> Some of the great artists had 
underlaborers -- skilled artisans who completed their works and put 
in the details. </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="evaluation"> Very important work too.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="89" relname="elaboration">  I guess you don&apos;t have to 
be a simpering lackey to be an underlaborer.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="14" relname="background">


I made a big deal about this in the review I did of 
&amp;gt; Callebaut&apos;s book in _Science_ (May 94). Philosophers involved in 
&amp;gt; cognitive science also talk this way. (I recall Jerry Fodor invoking the 
&amp;gt; underlaborer image a couple of times in his books.)
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Moreover, if you see the work of philosophy of science as primarily one 
&amp;gt; of clarifying concepts and arguments -- as SHANKS seems to -- then you&apos;ve 
&amp;gt; embraced the underlaborer role. The only sort of criticism being provided 
&amp;gt; is internal to the scientific enterprise.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="95" relname="span">

I guess I&apos;m guilty as charged. </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="94" relname="span"> The contribution of philosophy of 
science can indeed be valuable as an internal-to-science activity. </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="100" relname="span"> 
Here I think we finally come to something like the internal/external 
distinction that RICHARDSON mentioned a few days ago. </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="96" relname="preparation"> 

Here are some questions.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="96" relname="list">  Are all external criticisms of science 
equally valid?</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="96" relname="list">  Or are some more valid than others? </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="96" relname="list"> What is the 
standard for making a judgement here? </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="97" relname="solutionhood"> Are evidential considerations 
relevent? </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="97" relname="span"> If so, we run the danger of sneaking across the 
(internal/external) border into the province of science</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="circumstance"> -- where the 
grading of evidence for quality is one of the hallmarks of the 
activity properly done.  </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="101" relname="circumstance">

When BERNIE LIEBERMAN criticizes science (Bernie, I hope I&apos;m not 
misrepresenting you)</segment>
    <segment id="101" parent="105" relname="span"> he is concerned with (among other things) 
misleading claims made by scientists in public policy debates, 
especially in the context of Big Science.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="101" relname="enablement">  He is also worried, I take 
it, by the lack of promised results from some of the Big Science 
projects -- raising issues about value for money.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="106" relname="span">  Let me add that 
this can all be legitimate criticism.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="104" relname="span">  But how external to science is 
it? </segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="29" relname="circumstance"> When BERNIE has a go at the Cancer Gang,</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="102" relname="span"> he is an external 
critic in the sense that he is not a cancer researcher.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="103" relname="span">  But he 
thinks there is relevant evidence for his claims. </segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="30" relname="elaboration"> Marshalling that 
evidence in a rational manner could be construed as an activity 
internal to science itself, on a suitably broad and catholic 
construal of science.</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="33" relname="condition">  If there is an external/internal border,</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="107" relname="span"> it 
might turn out to be vague and/or shifty.</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="117" relname="span">

I take it (though perhaps this is hasty) that there will be few 
takers for the claim that criticisms of the misleading statements 
made by policy advocates on behalf of cancer researchers (and also by 
the researchers themselves) on the basis of a rational assessment of 
the evidence, is DIFFERENT IN KIND from the mindless meanderings of 
New Age critics of science (who are not infrequently indifferent to 
rational assessments of the evidence). </segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="36" relname="concession"> This latter (along with the 
sort of crapulous nonsense produced by (external) philosophical 
commentators such as Jacques Derrida) is certainly external to 
science,</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="109" relname="span"> but it hardly gains legitimization thereby!</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="116" relname="span">

Certainly you can have a scientific criticism (one based on a 
rational assessment of the evidence) of aspects of science itself -- </segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="110" relname="span">
these will, in the nature of the case, be local (cancer gangs, fusion 
gangs)</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="38" relname="antithesis"> rather than global (science itself)</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="110" relname="antithesis"> if the critical activity 
is not to become self-stultifying.</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="141" relname="span">

Now I&apos;ve done it!</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="112" relname="span">  I&apos;ve mentioned the possibility of rational 
assessemnts of the evidence.</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="113" relname="span">  Let me also mention truth, and come out 
of the wretched closet and say openly that I think truth and 
rationality DO have an explanatory role in science. </segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="43" relname="elaboration"> More of this 
below! </segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="46" relname="circumstance"> Since this is a bit &quot;old fashioned&quot;,</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="114" relname="span"> you may regard me as a 
&quot;Young Fogey&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="48" relname="antithesis">

 In fact, when you survey the 
&amp;gt; assortment of philosophers of science who line up between this or that 
&amp;gt; side in current theoretical controversies in science, it&apos;s easy to get 
&amp;gt; the impression that the philosophers are functioning much like defense 
&amp;gt; attorneys providing their clients with a clearer voice than the clients 
&amp;gt; themselves could. (Of course, minus the connotation that the attorneys 
&amp;gt; might bend a premise here or there to help the client win. Needless to 
&amp;gt; say, philosophical reconstructions of the history of science that 
&amp;gt; vindicate realism or instrumentalism would NEVER count as examples of 
&amp;gt; such behavior.)</segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="123" relname="span">

There is a substantial disanalogy here.</segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="51" relname="span">  Clarification of meaning is 
usually the first step towards establishing whether a particular 
statement is true or false.</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="121" relname="span">  To the extent that statements are 
imprecise, to that extent it will be hard to know what evidence would 
count as confirming/disconfirming evidence.</segment>
    <segment id="52" parent="120" relname="span">  Speaking in a clear 
voice is essential for the pursuit of truth</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="54" relname="concession"> (granted, you may not 
always hit the target,</segment>
    <segment id="54" parent="119" relname="span"> but it helps to shoot in the right direction).</segment>
    <segment id="55" parent="51" relname="elaboration">

The philosopher&apos;s role is substantially different from that of the 
shyster attorney whose job it is to get his/her client off at any 
cost, and regardless of actual innocence or guilt.</segment>
    <segment id="56" parent="142" relname="span">

OK, here it comes:</segment>
    <segment id="57" parent="128" relname="span"> truth and rationality have a legitimate 
explanatory role to play in science. </segment>
    <segment id="58" parent="124" relname="span"> First off, many scientists go 
into science as a career, and behave in the ways they do,</segment>
    <segment id="59" parent="58" relname="volitional-result"> because 
they BELIEVE that rational assessments of evidence (characteristic of 
science at its best) are the best ways to arrive at the truth of 
various matters of interest (choose your favorite field).</segment>
    <segment id="60" parent="61" relname="concession">  In the 
end, there will be much trading in probabilities,</segment>
    <segment id="61" parent="125" relname="span"> but rational 
individuals, all other things being equal, will tend to place more 
faith in the probable than the improbable (unlike new agers, for 
example).</segment>
    <segment id="62" parent="63" relname="concession">  Truth may also be approximated to various degrees</segment>
    <segment id="63" parent="126" relname="span"> -- but 
it is a fact, for example, the E = mc squared, rather than mc to the 
millionth power, or even mc cubed.</segment>
    <segment id="64" parent="65" relname="justify">  And as Quine tells us,</segment>
    <segment id="65" parent="127" relname="span"> all claims 
are revisable in the light of new EVIDENCE</segment>
    <segment id="67" parent="65" relname="elaboration"> -- even claims about the 
value-for-money of specific research programs.</segment>
    <segment id="66" parent="129" relname="span">

If most scientists did not believe they were aiming at the truth, and 
did not try to uphold the highest standards of rational inquiry </segment>
    <segment id="68" parent="66" relname="concession">
(sometimes falling by the wayside -- for even science has sinners), </segment>
    <segment id="69" parent="131" relname="span">
they would not behave the way they do </segment>
    <segment id="70" parent="69" relname="elaboration">(e.g, examining the contents of 
test tubes for properties of interest, as opposed to throwing the 
tubes against the floor or out of the window.) </segment>
    <segment id="71" parent="132" relname="span"> Science succeeds </segment>
    <segment id="73" parent="71" relname="nonvolitional-cause">
because the belief that rational inquiry is more likely than 
irrational inquiry to get you in TRUTH&apos;s ballpark, is itself true. </segment>
    <segment id="72" parent="130" relname="span"> 
There is obviously much more to science than this</segment>
    <segment id="74" parent="72" relname="elaboration"> (the economics of 
big-ticket projects, and so on),</segment>
    <segment id="75" parent="134" relname="span"> but it nevertheless seems to be 
correct that truth and rationality have explanatory value.</segment>
    <segment id="76" parent="77" relname="background">

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I know that some of you out there will think I am being incredibly unfair
&amp;gt; to philosophers of science by saying these things. Nevertheless, I would
&amp;gt; ask you to think about the suspicion with which people trained in the more
&amp;gt; traditional branches of philosophy (epistemology, metaphysics, ethics --
&amp;gt; but not the applied stuff) often regard philosophers of science. </segment>
    <segment id="77" parent="137" relname="span">

Not to mention the suspicion with which philosophers of science 
regard cavalier commentaries (often motivated not a little by Science 
Envy) of their non-scientific colleagues.</segment>
    <segment id="78" parent="136" relname="span">  Interested readers may 
wish to plumb the depths of Jacques Derrida&apos;s wisdom on the constancy 
of the speed of light</segment>
    <segment id="79" parent="78" relname="enablement"> (I think it is quoted by G&amp;L).</segment>
    <segment id="80" parent="81" relname="antithesis">

Many in
&amp;gt; these fields feel that philosophers of science have simply surrendered the
&amp;gt; domain of philosophical inquiry to the scientists. In fact, &quot;naturalism&quot;
&amp;gt; is often presented as a reasoned defense of such a move. Admittedly, this 
&amp;gt; tension between philosophers of science and other philosophers often 
&amp;gt; surfaces very abstractly. </segment>
    <segment id="81" parent="138" relname="span"> 

And often not so abstractly,</segment>
    <segment id="82" parent="81" relname="evidence"> as when religious critics of the 
theory of evolution (along with assorted fellow-travellers) use a 
critique of naturalism in order to persuade the courts for equal time 
for loony creationist hypotheses and even school prayer!</segment>
    <segment id="83" parent="84" relname="antithesis">
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; In any case, it does seem to me that philosophers of science -- of the
&amp;gt; underlaboring variety -- have a vested interest in science in a way that
&amp;gt; other philosophers do not have in other institutions.</segment>
    <segment id="84" parent="139" relname="span">

Hardly surprising,</segment>
    <segment id="85" parent="84" relname="evidence"> since philosophy of science, like medical ethics 
and so forth, is an applied discipline -- or is becoming increasingly 
so.

Response to COLLINS&apos;s Flaming Letter:</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="36" relname="span">

Now, I see why this debate doesn&apos;t get anywhere...</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="56" relname="span"> But on to the main points.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="39" relname="span">

(1) I decided to approach the scientists first because I figured that 
they would be the hardest to get involved in the project, especially 
given that a Sociology Department was getting the ball rolling. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="38" relname="span">
Conceivably, they might feel like they were being ambushed,</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="7" relname="condition"> and if they 
did,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="37" relname="span"> we had no conference. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="4" relname="circumstance">In any case, these guys were only contacted 
the day before yesterday,</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="4" relname="circumstance"> and I was going to be in New Orleans next week to 
see many of the UK sociologists en masse. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="55" relname="span">

(2) There is an open question as to who exactly is attacking whom.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="12" relname="antithesis"> Harry&apos;s 
article is just one of several in the THES issue.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="40" relname="span"> Many of the scientists 
feel like they&apos;re under attack,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="elaboration"> and the lead article by the THES reporter 
portrays the issue that way.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="concession"> I realize that Harry himself has taken a lot 
of blows from scientists in his day,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="41" relname="span"> but he&apos;s not the only one suffering 
here.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="47" relname="span">

(3) Another thing that Harry fails to ackowledge -- and which this
conference aims to address -- is that the hardcore of SSK people (are we
talking about 15 or 20 people maybe?) is not the only sociologically
oriented position under consideration in these debates.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="43" relname="span"> Certainly, hard
core SSK is a minority of the people who identify with the STS movement. </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="evidence">
In the UK alone, there are places like Manchester and Sussex that do STS
work but have little to do with SSK. </segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="44" relname="span">I imagine that even the historians of
science who have been inspired by the insights of SSK are bound to be miffed</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="nonvolitional-cause">
when Harry says that no one has done a case study of the DNA episode.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="concession">
Maybe no one has done a Collins-like case study,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="45" relname="span"> but certainly historical
studies have been done,</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="elaboration"> and these deserve to be aired, too, along with the
rest.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="25" relname="concession"> Historically, SSK has been very important in establishing the
academic identity of STS,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="48" relname="span"> but it is not the whole story by any means.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="25" relname="evaluation"> And 
nobody is served by making it look as though the entire sociology of 
science is summed up in _The Golem_. </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="28" relname="antithesis">

(4) I know Harry likes to pull the expert line, and draw a sharp 
distinction between what scientists know and what sociologists of science 
know.</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="53" relname="span"> Unfortunately, Harry hasn&apos;t yet convinced the scientists that there 
is a distinction,</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="50" relname="span"> and his rhetoric just invites them to throw the charge
back in his face:</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="29" relname="elaboration"> &apos;Harry, what do you know about physics?!&apos;</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="51" relname="span"> Part of the 
problem here is that there are many different reasons why people think 
sociology of science is worth doing</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="31" relname="background"> -- scientists even think this --</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="52" relname="span"> and 
that will influence how one wants to draw the line between the authority 
of the science studies practitioner and the scientist.</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="33" relname="evaluation"> Again, this needs 
to be aired.</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="57" relname="motivation">

I invite you all to get involved!</segment>

Back to Basics:</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="77" relname="span"> What&apos;s the Point</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="78" relname="span">

Maybe I&apos;m not alone in finding it quite confusing who is and is not 
addressing BAILAR&apos;s original query about the point of STS.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="46" relname="span"> Take for 
instance the dichotomy of &apos;insular&apos; vs. &apos;public&apos; which several people 
have been tossing around. </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="47" relname="span">

For me, to be &apos;insular&apos; is to take a &apos;business as usual&apos; attitude to the
research that we do in STS,</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="48" relname="span"> as if we&apos;re just like the physicists, literary
critics, and other tillers in the groves of academe.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="49" relname="span"> Everybody minds their
own turf, and that&apos;s the end of that.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="elaboration">  Sometimes we cooperate, sometimes
not.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="9" relname="circumstance"> When people talk about being interested in &apos;intellectual curiosity&apos;
and &apos;understanding the richness of science&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="50" relname="span"> I associate that with the
insular attitude.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="51" relname="span"> Why?  </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="70" relname="span">Two reasons: </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="57" relname="span">

(1) There is no reason to think that such goals are unique to STS.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="14" relname="evidence"> Indeed,
I bet that even self-avowed positivist physicists believe they had a rich
understanding of science before STSers came on the scene.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="56" relname="span"> So, to say one
does STS to get a rich understanding of science opens one to the retort:</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="53" relname="span">
Well, why don&apos;t you just become a scientist,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="condition"> if you&apos;re so enamored with
the subject! </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> My guess is that somebody like GALE actually feels the 
force of the retort,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="54" relname="span"> and so he actually does do some physics.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="20" relname="condition">

(2) If &apos;intellectual curiosity&apos; and a &apos;rich understanding of science&apos; were
the most publicly salient features of STS, </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="60" relname="span">then it would become a complete
mystery why STS seems to cause so much trouble for scientists</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="58" relname="span"> -- and THIS
is how STS has in fact managed to spill over into the public sphere:</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="59" relname="span"> as
deniers of truth, rationality, etc.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="background"> (ZLATKO made the point late one
night.)</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="62" relname="span"> Moreover, you don&apos;t have to be &apos;male&apos; or even particularly
&apos;agonistic&apos; to cause problems for scientists,</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="24" relname="evidence"> as I think a lot of people
in this discussion will agree.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="64" relname="span"> 

So, to my mind, the &apos;insular&apos; view ignores some pretty obvious features 
of the social context in which STS work is received.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="63" relname="span"> Admittedly, this is 
an ironic conclusion to reach,</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="27" relname="nonvolitional-result"> since STSers are supposedly so good at 
figuring out everybody else&apos;s social contexts.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="72" relname="span">

But what&apos;s this &apos;public&apos; view?</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="76" relname="span">  Well, first you don&apos;t shy away from the
fact that a lot of our antagonists have caught on to something quite
salient about STS work,</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="74" relname="span"> namely, it aims to understand science in a way
that does not require concepts like truth, rationality, etc.</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="33" relname="concession"> No matter how
much one wants to quibble with Gross &amp; Levitt, WOlpert, and Weinberg about
whether they interpreted this or that colleague right,</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="73" relname="span"> they at least get
the general drift</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="33" relname="elaboration"> -- and there&apos;s no point in our ignoring or denying it. </segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="36" relname="condition">

The problem is that, given the plethora of postmodern genres,</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="65" relname="span"> it&apos;s quite
easy these days to write about science without using the magic God-terms. </segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="75" relname="span">
But unfortunately, erasing the words does not eliminate the feelings that
go along with them.</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="39" relname="condition"> Scientists -- and others in the public -- genuinely
believe that without their belief in Truth, Rationality, etc.,</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="66" relname="span">
civilization would go down the tubes.</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="41" relname="condition"> If you think about how much of
modern social order is based on appeals to and trust in &apos;expertise&apos;,</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="69" relname="span"> you
come to realize just how much is at stake.</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="68" relname="span"> To say (following Latour)
&apos;We&apos;ve never been modern&apos; is to do little more than to tell an insider&apos;s
joke.</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="44" relname="condition"> If you&apos;ve got a way to show non-STSers the humor in the remark,</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="67" relname="span"> then
you&apos;ve started to address the public mission of STS.</segment>

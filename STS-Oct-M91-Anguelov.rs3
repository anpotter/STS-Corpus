    <segment id="2" parent="49" relname="span">

&amp;lt;In the case of reducing human suffering from cancer, some of the above
&amp;lt;remarks about &apos;magic bullets&apos; apply here as well. Also, much of the
&amp;lt;grandiose rhetoric about fighting a &apos;war on cancer&apos; has backfired on the
&amp;lt;scientific community, even though it licensed vast amounts of government
&amp;lt;money in the early days. Once again, STSers could point out the value of a
&amp;lt;tempered rhetoric to prevent manic-depressive public responses. In
&amp;lt;addition, there may be something to be said for STSers destabilizing the
&amp;lt;idea that life is worth preserving at any cost, including endless
&amp;lt;suffering from treatments that merely retard the advance of cancer. Here
&amp;lt;some anthropology of medicine -- and indeed some history of our own
&amp;lt;culture from before the hegemony of scientific medicine -- would offer
&amp;lt;alternative models for dealing with matters of life-and-death.
&amp;lt;
&amp;lt;As my last remarks suggest, one thing STSers can do generally is to
&amp;lt;juxtapose examples from practices in our own cultural past or from that of
&amp;lt;other cultures to show that things have been -- and can be -- done
&amp;lt;differently.  This applies no less to the science policy apparatus itself,
&amp;lt;which -- as was pointed out by several of us a few weeks ago -- is a
&amp;lt;relatively recent invention. Showing how the &apos;peer review vs. pork&apos;
&amp;lt;distinction got constructed in the first place can be very illuminating in
&amp;lt;helping us now construct alternative courses of action. Scientists are
&amp;lt;professionally trained to have historical amnesia with regard to such
&amp;lt;sacred matters as the social construction of merit, and here STSers can
&amp;lt;refresh their memories.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="50" relname="span">

       In general, what FULLER says here reads very reasonable.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="82" relname="span"> But let me point
out another aspect of this intractable problem.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="81" relname="list"> First of all, in the whole
enterprise of STS it is not clear who is to be rectified: scientists or science?</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="51" relname="span">
And second of all, if it is scientists</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="background"> (as seems to be the implication of
FULLER&apos;s and VAN DEN MEULEN&apos;s examples),</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="77" relname="span"> who has assigned the task of rectifiers
to the STSents?</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> [STSents themselves are scientists as well, at least in terms of
being dependable on funding, public recognition and some social status.]</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="52" relname="span">

       Ideally, and also in the context of FULLER&apos;s and VAN DEN MEULEN&apos;s example
STS should be regarded as a form of narcissism:</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="elaboration"> scientists look upon scientists
in the endeavour to prove how good and beautiful scientists&apos; products may be.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="10" relname="elaboration">
They should be advertisers of scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="76" relname="span"> In the real world out there just the
opposite happens:</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration"> STS have been bitterly critical to scientists and in the same
time have sought for recognition by those people they so relentlessly criticize.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="16" relname="antithesis">
It turns out, in the real world, that the self-hired STSents do not prove how
admirable scientists are,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="53" relname="span"> but demonstrate how disgustingly scientists behave.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="elaboration"> Th
trigger of STS was the doubt that science - in a philosophical sense - wasn&apos;t
constructed on first principles;</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="16" relname="elaboration"> the result of STS has been so far that
scientists - in practical sense - are arrogant, useless, truthless, helpless, yo
have it.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="20" relname="background">

       I&apos;ll take AIDS as an example and will stick to the provision of VAN DEN
MEULEN that &quot;Scientists [...] face problems in how science goes and how it is
embedded in society&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="54" relname="span"> From the very onset of the pandemic, and especially during
the hot 1988-1991, AIDS activists and HIV-people pushed US government for more
money and US science for more involvement presuming that the delay of the
solution (some panaceic medicine) is due to negligence and carelessness, to
filthy political calculations, etc. </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="condition">If you discard the rhetoric,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="56" relname="span"> the message was
crystal clear:</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="24" relname="concession"> we believe that science is able to do everything,</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="55" relname="span"> but scientists
are corrupt bastards and play on the tune of politicians.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="59" relname="span"> It is hard to find
better example of a socially constructed, viable idea of the scientific
enterprise by lay people.</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="60" relname="span"> Isn&apos;t this very idea implied in the STS strain to
attack scientists, to be against, to be nasty?</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="62" relname="span">

       Scientists, on their part, knew that at that time the desperately needed
solution was nowhere - and knew this without recourse to STSents - and that the
believed omnipotence of science is only a myth. </segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="29" relname="concession">True, they benefited from the
conjuncture to raise more money toward AIDS-research,</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="61" relname="span"> but did not abandon the
systemic approach, which is the only possible and reasonable approach.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="66" relname="span"> Where wer
STS in this case?</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="32" relname="condition"> And if they were out there,</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="65" relname="span"> how could STS advise AIDS-research
to do better?</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="34" relname="antithesis"> It is one thing to shake the fundamental authority of the natural
sciences in order to acquire authority for the social ones,</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="63" relname="span"> and another thing to
try to help science policies that promote the social usefulness of science.</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="36" relname="concession"> To
take a good contrast in the near neighbourhood, linguists of the Chomskian type
study assiduously the structure of language,</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="64" relname="span"> but they don&apos;t teach people how to
speak their native language.</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="68" relname="span">

       What I&apos;m heading to is the contention that STS might be a refined
instrument to study the anatomy and physiology of the sciences and the
technologies, </segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="37" relname="condition">if it shrugs off the political momentum and the complex of the non
recognized.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="69" relname="span"> It is sufficiently anti-narcistic, I believe, to embark on systemic
studies of the sciences and the technologies as systems acquiring and applying
knowledge in a social and cultural context.</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="70" relname="span"> In this regard, I fully concur with
JOHN (apologies, but my machine saved his Oct 25th&apos;s post without the address
part) that the 4 general implications of this current debate are &quot;odd things&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="40" relname="elaboration">
We don&apos;t necessarily need a dialogue between STSents and scientists to achieve
meaning, recognition and &quot;bright future&quot; for STS.</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="72" relname="span"> I find it naive, too, to gathe
crumble by crumble &quot;positive&quot; projects to counter the sense of inferiority or,
at least, to jump out of the critical niche.</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="71" relname="span">

       As a matter of fact, it is in FULLER (&quot;Philosophy, Rhetoric and the End o
Knowledge:... UW Press, Madison, 1993)</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="43" relname="elaboration"> where STS is rightly defined as &quot;capable
[...] of making the academy more permeable to the rest of society&quot;.</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="75" relname="span"> The point is
HOW to do this.</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="47" relname="antithesis"> By begrudging academy&apos;s power, by belittling academy&apos;s authority
by dismissing academy&apos;s epistemology?</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="73" relname="span"> Or by acknowledging it as a system for
acquiring knowledge among many, and analytically representing its features?</segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="47" relname="elaboration"> I
assume that STS may well become the so needed anthropology of scientists
providing the lacking cultural dimension of academic science as just one sociall
constructed complex of cognition and adaptation.</segment>

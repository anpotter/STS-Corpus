&amp;gt; But I&apos;m not sure that opening up space for scientists will be
&amp;gt; enough.  They will need to see some reason to become engaged.
&amp;gt; And this brings me back to my original question, restated a few
&amp;gt; weeks ago here, about the ultimate purposes of our work (as
&amp;gt; well as theirs).  Can we help them produce a strain of rice
&amp;gt; with a higher yield, or come up with the Grand Unified Theory
&amp;gt; of physics, or reduce human suffering from cancer, or anything
&amp;gt; else they may care about?  Conversely, can we show that their
&amp;gt; talents would be better invested in some other approach to the
&amp;gt; elucidation of natural phenomena, or that their meritocratic
&amp;gt; approach to the big decisions of science is sub- optimal in
&amp;gt; some way not yet defined, or that society would be better
&amp;gt; served if science were harnessed more directly to political
&amp;gt; objectives?  Plug in your own favored questions here -- the
&amp;gt; point is that the working scientist is unlikely to become
&amp;gt; engaged unless you show him/her, in clear terms, that such
&amp;gt; engagement may matter.  One approach that will get their
&amp;gt; attention is, of course, the threat that science will be
&amp;gt; marginalized, but is that what we want?  If not, what DO we 
&amp;gt; want, and why, and how can we get there?
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Am I too ill-informed, or too slow to pick up on things, or 
&amp;gt; otherwise behind the rest of you?  Or would I be correct in 
&amp;gt; concluding that we have little to offer, whether to the 
&amp;gt; scientist or the public?  Is there reason to think that we will 
&amp;gt; have more to offer in the future?  (My own answers would be No, 
&amp;gt; Yes, nsd Yes, but maybe some of you have other answers.)

I think, at least in some few cases, the scientists are in a position in

Thus, in the short term at least, one relevant research area we could

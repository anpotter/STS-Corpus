&amp;gt; STSers,
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Re TURTON&apos;s recent posting, STS does not need to convince policymakers very
&amp;gt; much about science at all; it turns out, in research by JASANOFF and others
&amp;gt; (including work I have done solo and with colleague Bruce Bimber) that some
&amp;gt; policymakers in the courts and regulatory agencies (Jasanoff) and in Congress
&amp;gt; (Bimber &amp; Guston) already have a good idea of the role of power, position,
&amp;gt; uncertainty, experimental regress, flaws of peer review, interested nature of
&amp;gt; norms, etc. in the practice of science and in its interface with policy.  To
&amp;gt; a certain extent, we as researchers have been behind the curve of
&amp;gt; policymakers who, having learned that science is more like other enterprises
&amp;gt; than they had previously imagined, have already continued to make policy
&amp;gt; without having a new theory of how such a normal, political science might be
&amp;gt; governed.

&quot;The Perils of Democratizing Science,&quot; by Normal Levitt &amp; Paul R. 
Gross

&quot;The old respect [for science]...is being supplanted by hostile 
criticism, which ranges from the tendentious to ludicrous...Unlike 
the manifestations of hatred of science in the past, which arose 
typically from religious orthodoxy or Romantic conservatism, 
contemporary science bashing is a sport of the academic left. Radical 
critics insist that science is no more than a social artifact, that 
its ideas are &quot;constructed&quot; purely on the basis of social pressures 
and prejudices...

...Any recognition that science pursued according to these viewpoints 
[i.e., according to the &quot;interests of the dispossessed&quot;] might, in 
fact, simply be warped by new, though different, political biases is 
suppressed by scholars steeped in the &quot;sociology of scientific 
knowledge.&quot; This perspective is firmly grounded in relativism, the 
central point of which is that any community&apos;s &quot;:way of knowing&quot; is 
as good as any other&apos;s. Why not, then, &quot;construct&quot; a science that 
flatters _your_ community&apos;s hopes?&quot;


&quot;The proposition that science is merely socially determined 
convention, that it is ridden with the biases of a hermetic 
scientific community, that scientists pursue not truth but profitable 
consensus -- such opinions are not only held by a number of ambitious 
academics; they also appear to be gaining ground, albeit in toned-
down form, among a vastly larger audience of journalists, 
politicians, students, and general readers. Absorbing aspects of 
these ideological judgments leads otherwise intelligent people to 
take seriously the idea that the way science &quot;works&quot; is just a 
matter of negotiation and persuasion.&quot;

&quot;Many intellectuals, new to debates over scientific issues, are 
convinced that the apparent difficulty of science lies in its jargon, 
not in the subtlety of its content, and that the ability to contest 
scientific positions requires only learning the sociology and 
politics of science. Thus they ignore the wrestling with concepts 
that is the heart of science education. Even worse, they overlook the 
methodological savvy needed to understand complex phenomena -- the 
need to have some grasp of the principles of probability and 
statistics, for example.&quot;</segment>

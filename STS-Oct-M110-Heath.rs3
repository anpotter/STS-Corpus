&amp;gt; I want to explain why I had misgivings about what [Traweek] and some of the
&amp;gt; anthropologists (I include here HEATH, STOCKDALE, EGLASH) were saying
&amp;gt; about the STS-scientist interaction. 
&amp;gt; It seemed to me that the tenor of your (plural) remarks was that the
&amp;gt; entire question was being framed wrong, and that once we look at things
&amp;gt; somewhat differently, the question will dissolve: i.e., in some sense
&amp;gt; there is NO problem with STS-scientist interaction. Given the sorts of
&amp;gt; things that both STSers and scientists have been writing lately about
&amp;gt; their interactions, I found the claim surprising and wanted to find out
&amp;gt; more.</segment>

&amp;gt;From the ethnographic perspective, the question about _whether_ to engage

&amp;gt; I was then puzzled by some of the things I read: For example, HEATH said
&amp;gt; that scientists were &apos;sources&apos;, no mere objects of critique of both the
&amp;gt; STSers&apos; and the scientists&apos; practices. I wondered what this meant in
&amp;gt; practice</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="45" relname="list">

I could mention, for ex., a biochemist who cites Marx in critiquing
scientific citation practices that deny technicians credit for their work. </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="45" relname="list">
Or, perhaps, in response to Ron Eglash&apos;s account of the physicist who was
annoyed by Donna Haraway&apos;s pep talk to ecofeminists, I could put him in
touch with any number of women scientists and technicians whose accounts
of &quot;science-as-male-domination&quot; are based on their lived experience (and
often on their readings of works in feminist science studies);</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="47" relname="span"> these
accounts are part of the &quot;native&quot; cultural terrain. </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="elaboration"> As Bakhtin reminds
us, all signifying practice contains both &quot;centripetal&quot; and &quot;centrifugal&quot;

&amp;gt;  it MAY mean that both STSers and scientists benefit from
&amp;gt; the interaction, but for different reasons -- much like exchange relations
&amp;gt; in capitalism, in which each trader has something that the other wants.
&amp;gt; There is constructive interaction, in a sense, but no one comes away
&amp;gt; fundamentally changed. In fact, the traders are reinforced in their 
&amp;gt; positions.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="26" relname="span">

Instrumentalist exchange theory may certainly account for some encounters 
between STSers and technoscientists. </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="27" relname="span"> There are also other models or 
metaphors-- actant networks? interethnic marriage? cyborgian unions?-- that 
admit the possibility [and even the desirability] that both parties to 
these encounters [esp. the long-term variety] end up seeing the world[s] 
differently, or at least understanding one another&apos;s worldviews as more 
complex, less caricatural.</segment>

&amp;gt; [T]he interests of
&amp;gt; the scientist and the STSer never really intersect at a point of critical
&amp;gt; engagement, where both sides are forced to recognize incompatibilities    
&amp;gt; between the scientist&apos;s project and the STSer&apos;s project....
&amp;gt; Is there NO place for critical engagement in this picture, or 
&amp;gt; am I just not looking at things the right way?</segment>

Well, Steve, from my perspective, you&apos;re just not looking at things the
right way.</segment>

There seems to be a few odd things about the general line in this debate:</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="23" relname="list">
1. The general consensus that dialogue between STSers &amp; scientists is a
good idea.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="23" relname="list">
2. The so far implicit idea that STS actually needs to be recognised and
engaged with by scientists in order that STSers feel that their practice is
legitimate.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="23" relname="list">
3. The general assumption that academic work on a topic (studies of
science) should/will/ought to have an impact on later work in the sciences.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="23" relname="list">
4. That dialogue will somehow &apos;move things forward&apos;.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="24" relname="span">
The first of these is rather strange:</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="elaboration"> change the context and see how it
might work: </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="24" relname="evidence"> why should, say, novelists &amp; artists have a need to talk to
literary critics?;</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="24" relname="evidence"> why should politicians be assumed to have an interest in
the work of historians?; </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="24" relname="evidence">and, more specific to STS, why should someone
trying to build a laser first go and read Harry Collins?</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="26" relname="background">
The second in my list might help to pose some awkward questions for our own
practice here:</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="concession"> sure, it might be nice for some of us to have work read by
scientists,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="26" relname="list"> but does academic enquiry really need this sort of post-hoc
legitimation?</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="26" relname="list">  Reversing the order of point 2, is this merely a way of
increasing the importance of STS work by building a quasi-requirement that
scientists do engage with it in order that their own practice is cosher?</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="22" relname="list">
On the third point: this seems to be a misguided - if not downright silly -
thing to hold.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="29" relname="span">
On the fourth point: forward towards what exactly? </segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="18" relname="span"> Doesn&apos;t this sound like
very basic progressionist talk?</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="28" relname="span">  There seems to be the strange assumption
here that, after dialogue is achieved, drains will be unblocked and the
passage will be clear towards a bright new future - and that some of us can
even see what gifts will arrive if such a dialogue is undertaken. </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="evaluation"> Somehow,
I just don&apos;t buy this.

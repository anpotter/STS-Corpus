    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="background">Did anyone else notice the full-page ad in the Sept 9 issue of 
Science, with the capp&apos;d headline: SCIENCE IS UNDER ATTACK? (pg. 
1508)?</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="20" relname="span">

It announces an up-coming National Association of Scholars 
conference, entitled: &quot;Objectivity and Truth in the Natural Sciences, 
the Social Sciences, and the Humanities&quot; (Nov 11-13, Cambridge).</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="elaboration"> 
Invited speakers include: Steven Weinberg, Gerald Holton, Paul Gross, 
Gerald Weissmann, and Michael McElroy.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="5" relname="preparation">

Concerning SCIENCE IS UNDER ATTACK, the ad proclaims:</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="19" relname="span">

&quot;Formerly the attacks came from outside the academic and scientific 
disciplines. Increasingly, now they come from within. These attacks 
are dangerous: 
  They undermine public confidence
  They alter directions of research
  They affect funding
  They subvert the standards of reason and proof.&quot;</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="20" relname="interpretation">
  
I can only assume, from these comments and from the invited speakers, 
that the drift of the conference will include -- if not specially 
emphasize -- the scientific community&apos;s response to recent 
developments in the STS literature, particularly social 
constructivism.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="27" relname="span">

As a political scientist, and therefore more an observer of 
social constructivist developments than a direct participant, I have 
been curious about the general lack of information and concern 
expressed within the scientific community for these theoretical moves 
so common within our STS community.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="21" relname="span"> In a recent review of Brian 
Martin&apos;s book on the fluoridation debate for Chemical &amp; Engineering 
News, I had to fax them a two page summary of the constructivist 
position before they could understand the references in the review.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="background"> I 
remarked to them at the time the irony that I, a political scientist, 
had to explain recent developments in science studies to practicing 
scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="26" relname="span">

Now, of course, we see the scientific community awakening to what&apos;s 
been going on in STS for the past 15 years,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="elaboration"> and that community -- or 
at least some noted spokespersons -- is clearly frightened and 
panicked by the STS literature.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="concession"> I suppose after long neglest, it&apos;s 
nice to be noticed, at all.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="24" relname="span"> However, I fear that the barrage of 
criticisms will overwhelm the theoretical insights that STS has to 
offer to newly aroused scientists.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="22" relname="span"> The contributions of our field 
will get lumped with other suspect intellectual movements,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="23" relname="span"> and we may 
find ourselves defensively responding to the scorn of scientists who, 
themselves, have not examined the STS literature, but have followed 
the lead of the few scientists who have published attacks.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="25" relname="nonvolitional-result"> I 
certainly think these developments will make even more difficult
various efforts to build STS programs on campuses.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="29" relname="span">

What do you think our collective/individual responses should be?</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="elaboration"> Now 
that we&apos;re noticed, but misread, how can we build politically 
expeditious yet intellectually rigorous bridges to the communities of 
practitioners, researchers, and teachers we study?</segment>

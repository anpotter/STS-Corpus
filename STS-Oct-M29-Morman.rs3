    <segment id="1" parent="3" relname="antithesis">&amp;gt; A third-world nation (with a deep commitment to &quot;technoscience&quot; and
&amp;gt; thousands of intelligent people doing it) has just--last week--turned to
&amp;gt; pathology, public health, and sanitary engineering to stop in its tracks
&amp;gt; (it is hoped!) a threatened pandemic of pneumonic plague.  It even made
&amp;gt; the papers. </segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="42" relname="span">

GROSS might do well to consult the literature of historical demography and
medical history to learn something about the significance (or relative
lack thereof) of scientific research in the transformation of disease
patterns in what we now think of as the &quot;developed world.&quot; </segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="2" relname="span"> Scientists and
physicians working in pathology and medical bacteriology in the late 19th
century were indeed learning a lot about pathogenesis, much of which we
still tend to accept as an accurate depiction of reality. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="30" relname="span"> They were not,
however, contributing to the huge declines in mortality from most of the
serious infectious diseases. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="31" relname="span">

19th-century public health and sanitary engineering were not particularly
science-based.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="elaboration">  Most sanitary campaigns were understood in terms of the
filth theory of disease. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="32" relname="span"> Moreover, the degree to which even public 
health and engineering influenced disease patterns is subject to debate. </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="evidence">
Improvements in nutrition, housing, and other aspects of living standard
(events incidental to rapidly expanding industrial economies) are
generally credited with having a major effect. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="43" relname="span"> I urge GROSS to sit down
with Richard Evans&apos;s _Death in Hamburg_, especially the last few chapters,
for a very well-informed historical discussion on the relative importance
of social reform and science in the improvement of the public health. </segment>

_Death in Hamburg_, by the way, concentrates on the experience of cholera
in Hamburg in the nineteenth century. </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="33" relname="span"> It is shocking that cholera, a
water-borne bacterial disease, has recently re-emerged in parts of the
world where it hadn&apos;t been seen in a hundred years. </segment>

co-thinkers believe that this is a result of the absence of science? </segment>

has something to do, rather, with the effects of austerity on the public
works infrastructure.</segment>

The resurgence of measles and tuberculosis provides other examples of how
public policy -- not particularly related to support of or opposition to
science -- affects health.</segment>

tuberculosis has to do with an over-dependence on science-based medicine.</segment>

Antibiotics entered the scene when tb was all but conquered in the

something to do with the recent outbreaks of plague there,</segment>

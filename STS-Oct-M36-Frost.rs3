&amp;gt;If LIEBERMAN or anyone else genuinely believes that STS convincingly
&amp;gt;demonstrates that external reality doesn&apos;t exist, I would like to be
&amp;gt;notified of just where and how this has been done. On my reading, most STS
&amp;gt;literature asserts, and often demonstrates, some form of interpretive
&amp;gt;flexibility in scientific claims or technological design. But there is a
&amp;gt;vast difference between flexibility, an excellent metaphor whose
&amp;gt;connotations should be taken seriously, and infinite malleability - which
&amp;gt;doesn&apos;t even work as a metaphor (from what experiential background could it
&amp;gt;be drawn?), much less as a coherent literal description of anything at all.
&amp;gt;The most common philosophical mistake in STS is to leap from the
&amp;gt;possibility of _multiple_ interpretations or constructions to the
&amp;gt;possibility of an _infinite_ number. When something flexes too far, it
&amp;gt;breaks.</segment>

Excellent!</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="antithesis"> Social construction needn&apos;t be philosophically assimilated with
the more perverse spinoffs of German idealism.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="20" relname="span"> To Paul Edwards&apos; perceptive
comments on the value of the notion of interpretive flexibility, I&apos;d add
that not only are meanings and truths implicitly negotiated, the more
durable outcome of such controversies or fact-makings is a sort of
constructive ambiguity.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="7" relname="condition"> If a meaning or truth is subject to multiple social
meanings</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="19" relname="span"> it is less brittle and less apt to crack under social or political
pressure.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="7" relname="elaboration"> Take nuclear power (which, of course didn&apos;t have a sufficiently
flexible/ambiguous meaning)--it had many meanings from &quot;too cheap to meter&quot;
to a symboll of American (or French) techno-prowess.</segment>

    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="concession">The recent volley back-and-forth on re-describing science from other language
frames not only seemed to me right,</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="9" relname="span"> it awoke a nagging half-memory in me,
of having seen something relevant to the same topic.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="13" relname="span"> A bit of searching (of
memory, and of texts) revealed the following from the Jan &apos;93 issue of
the _American Jl. of Physics_.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration">
&quot;What follows is a tale of physicists entangled among philosophical 
snares, scientists attempting to discover that well-disguised trail they 
thought most likely to lead to the goal sought by all, namely, good, 
solid science.  We relate this tale in philosophical terms, from the 
point of view of the philosopher, since that, after all, is indeed our 
perspective.  Yet, even though the terms and identifications might seem 
alien to today&apos;s students of the physicist&apos;s art, there most probably 
exists none the less some rude edification for them to encounter along 
the way.  For, no matter the philosopher&apos;s penchant to deploy and 
exploit ancient taxonomies and arcane systems of categories, in the end 
it is physics and physicists which recognizably serve as targets of the 
philosophical exercise, and its is the activities of these targets which 
contain the message modulating the medium.  In any case, in the end it 
is perhaps useful and exhilarating to see one&apos;s life pinned-down, laid 
out, exposed in someone else&apos;s dissecting pan. &quot;</segment>

The bald truth of the fact that memory is the second thing to go is most
unfortunately revealed by the further fact that I wrote the damn passage,
and had forgotten specifically that I had done so,</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="14" relname="span"> but generally remembered
that I agreed with what was going on between KEITH and EDWARDS.</segment>

Uhhh, (or rather &quot;duh&quot;) I still agree with what I wrote three long years ago,</segment>

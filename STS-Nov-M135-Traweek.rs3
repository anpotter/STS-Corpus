    <segment id="1" parent="24" relname="sequence">Authoritarians have a long history of throwing together groups of people 
who can&apos;t stand each other and then oppressing the whole fractious 
bunch, while appealing to the public [especially the privileged] about how 
the diverse groups all oppose public order.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="24" relname="sequence"> The oppressors then gain 
considerable resources through the support of all those who, of course, 
prefer public order to disorder.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="46" relname="span">  This scenario is so frequently rehersed 
that it can be summarized tritely,</segment>

I have been intrigued how our own little fractious bunch [policy makers, 
policy critics, strong programmers, constructivists, methodological 
relativists, feminist epistemologists, rhetoricians, scientometricians, 
all-around judicious types, ET AL] was going to deal with this current,
increasingly disturbing anti-sts &apos;backlash&apos; in the US and UK.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="4" relname="background">  [I haven&apos;t 
heard of it going on elsewhere.] </segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="47" relname="span"> Most of us have been politely silent 
about this growing anti-sts backlash,</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="7" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> in part because of the company we 
would need to keep [see list above] in order to act effectively.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="10" relname="background">

I just heard this morning from a colleague - not at all in science 
studies of any kind - that she had heard about a recent US national meeting 
of deans of sci/eng where one speaker &apos;instructed&apos; the other deans in the 
pernicious work being done on sci/eng, perhaps on their own campuses.  </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="26" relname="span">
The speaker apparently blamed all of this on - guess what - literary 
theory.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="32" relname="span">  In case any of you are suddenly feeling relieved</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="11" relname="elaboration"> - oh, I don&apos;t 
do litcrit -</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="33" relname="span"> then you are an example of the effectiveness of the backlash 
stragegy of oppressing fractious groups, in my opinion.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="43" relname="span">

I agree strongly with David Hakken that we need to be thinking together 
about diverse [I repeat: diverse] strategies to respond effectively to this 
strengthening backlash.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="40" relname="span">  David suggests &quot;intense engagement&quot; with the 
scientists and engineers whose practices we are studying. </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="13" relname="elaboration"> For those of 
us who are already so engaged, I agree, certainly, that we can increase 
our discussions with them about our work and the anti-sts crusades.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="38" relname="solutionhood">

What else? </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="background"> 
Looking at the source materials I assume that most of us would agree 
that reacting to the backlash must involve exposing the - well, I&apos;ll be 
polite - amazingly inventive readings of diverse people&apos;s work, coupled 
with amazingly inventive ways of putting together ideas that most 
readers would regard as immiscible.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="37" relname="span">  While certainly not difficult,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="38" relname="span">
this will be a tedious task.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="20" relname="preparation">  The next problem:</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="27" relname="span">  how to give the critique 
the exposure of the backlash. </segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="41" relname="span"> I suggest that this is already nearly 
insurmountable.</segment>

&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; As a scientist and an STS scholar, I do not find an inherent conflict
&amp;gt; in the two positions, but I do find the arguments being made by some
&amp;gt; of my colleagues (on both sides of the aisle) extremely damaging. Our
&amp;gt; central thesis is NOT that the real world does not exist. Responses of
&amp;gt; SCAREDY CAT, SCAREDY CAT..., however, are hardly likely to win
&amp;gt; moderate and liberal scientists to STS. It seems to me that the way to
&amp;gt; proceed is to challenge science instead of provoking it.</segment>

Traweek&apos;s observation concerning the silence around &quot;the backlash&quot; seems
especially important given who has continually been singled out in  the
criticism to STS that I&apos;ve seen: </segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="28" relname="span">feminist scholars of science.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="29" relname="span"> As evidence
consider the review of G&amp;L in the most recent The Sciences.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="5" relname="concession"> In that piece
G&amp;L are roundly criticized,</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="27" relname="span"> but the author ironically ends up supporting
Gross&apos;s picture of feminist science scholars, esp. Harding.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="evidence"> In the  Michael
Ruse&apos;s words &quot;The hatred [of science by feminists] is real and deep.&quot; (p.
40)</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="39" relname="span">

My concerns about this singling out the feminsts by both conservative and
liberal critics is multiple.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="38" relname="list"> First, it repeats too much bad history,
including the continued marginalization of what, imho, is some of the
finest work on science and its relation to culture, from something vaguely
defined as the mainstream of STS.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="11" relname="circumstance"> As has already been noted by several
people in this list,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="34" relname="span"> feminist scholarship has not impacted the &quot;mainstream&quot;
of STS...</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="13" relname="concession"> (Actually I think it has,</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="31" relname="span"> but I&apos;ve seen scant evidence of it on
this list--</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="33" relname="span">my own work and those of others  in the anthropological and
cultural studies arm of STS are thoroughly indebted to feminism:</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="32" relname="span"> without
Haraway, Traweek, Harding, Penley, Martin et alia I certainly wouldn&apos;t be
doing what I&apos;m doing.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="evaluation"> They are as, if not more, important to my research on
science and tourism than the likes of Latour.)</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="34" relname="interpretation"> Given this seeming marginal
status, we (they) are an easy target.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="37" relname="span">

Finally, it&apos;s worth pointing out that the critique is founded on a perverse
reading of the feminist critique of science, one that begins by assuming
that critique is identical with blanket condemnation.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="17" relname="evidence"> The fact that
Haraway&apos;s work is an attempt to interest and signal the importance of
scientific work--any careful reading of her would find that she values
science--is completely ignored.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="36" relname="span">  Harding&apos;s comments about the necessity of
science are likewise ignored:</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="19" relname="evidence"> See pp. 101-2 of Whose Science, Whose
Knowledge.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="concession"> Yes the feminist critiques of science are harsh,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="43" relname="span"> but they are
not out to &quot;dismantle&quot; science as &quot;anti-feminist&quot; critics have charged.</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="40" relname="span">

As the criticisms continue to target Harding in particular,</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="23" relname="background"> and I too sense
a silence on the part of &quot;the mainstream&quot; STS community (which are not of a
piece I am more than happy to acknowledge)</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="41" relname="span"> I&apos;m reminded of a poem of Marge
Piercy&apos;s:</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="42" relname="span">

        watch who they beat and who they eat,
        watch who they relieve themselves on, watch who they own,
        The rest is decoration. (Circles on the Water, p. 80)

    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="attribution">Response to EDWARDS, KEITH, et al.:</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="67" relname="span"> Do science studies
redescriptions destabilize science?</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="63" relname="span">

I think the UK experience of the past few weeks supports KEITH&apos;s
view that they do indeed destabilize, usually quite unwittingly
and perhaps not productively.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="5" relname="concession"> In the THES, Harry Collins talks
about science as working like a craft guild and thinks he&apos;s
paying a compliment to the skilled practices of scientists,</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="38" relname="span"> but
he is then read by scientists as trivializing the entire
enterprise.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="39" relname="span"> This is quite striking,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="elaboration"> especially considering that
Collins has made a studious effort to avoid sounding like he&apos;s
debunking scientists. </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="42" relname="span">

I doubt that a much better reception would be forthcoming to
people who produce &quot;thick&quot; descriptions, such as Karin Knorr-
Cetina.</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="44" relname="span"> You can&apos;t quite repair the damage done to the
&quot;specialness&quot; of science by saying that aspects of science
resemble a myriad of non-scientific practices.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="43" relname="span"> By comparison,
even the most carefully wrought anthropology of religion is bound
to provide some offense to the True Believer,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> since the
anthropologist has made a methodological decision not to take
professions of faith as self-explanatory. </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="45" relname="span">

It&apos;s not that hard to open up space for scientists to voice their
opinions in science studies narratives. </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="12" relname="elaboration">In fact, this is
routinely done.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="64" relname="span"> The tough question -- which EDWARDS hasn&apos;t really
addressed -- is how much authority you grant those opinions in
directing the course of your own narrative.</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="49" relname="span"> Usually, this
question is answered by simply not addressing your narrative to
scientists (or hoping they don&apos;t read you!).</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="46" relname="span"> In that case,
scientists&apos; words are quickly converted to symptoms</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="background"> (or &apos;signs&apos;,
if one is a bit more neutral).</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="19" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> But scientists are now beginning
to take our stuff seriously,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="47" relname="span"> and so this particular form of
evasion is not going to work much longer. </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="57" relname="span">

Also, it&apos;s much too facile to say that scientists and science
studies practitioners are doing &apos;different but complementary&apos;
things.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="22" relname="antithesis"> (Nobody has actually said this yet,</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="50" relname="span"> but I bet many of you
out there believe this.)</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="evidence"> Gross &amp; Levitt -- and other scientists
who&apos;ve written about science studies recently -- clearly think
we&apos;ve moved into their epistemic turf.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="51" relname="disjunction"> Have we all collectively
misspoken,</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="51" relname="disjunction"> or the scientists collectively misheard?</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="54" relname="span">  I doubt it. </segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="28" relname="antithesis">
While it is definitely wrong to say that science studies as a
whole should be lumped with &apos;anti-science&apos; movements (pace Gerald
Holton),</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="53" relname="span"> science studies IS anti-something-about-science.</segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="52" relname="span"> What
that something is, however, is rarely made clear in our work</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="29" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> --
in part because it&apos;s probably different things for different
people.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="56" relname="span"> But it&apos;s got to be made more explicit.</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="31" relname="evidence"> Simply saying that
we have methodologically rigorous ways of going about our
business (a common defense currently used) doesn&apos;t address the
question of WHY we&apos;re interested in generating the particular
redescriptions of science that science studies tends to produce,
especially given the way they jar with popular, philosophical,
and scientists&apos; own descriptions of what science is like. </segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="60" relname="span">

By the way, it&apos;s also worth noting that there are lots of ways
in which science studies can &apos;destabilize&apos; science.</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="35" relname="concession"> Of course,
discouraging young people from entering science at all -- a
particular concern of Gross &amp; Levitt -- is one way.</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="59" relname="span"> But another
way is to discourage young people, already set on scientific
careers, from pursuing basic research or, more modestly, from
pursuing certain sciences (e.g. high energy physics) that seem
especially oblivious to its social dimensions.</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="61" relname="span"> My guess is that
even Paul Gross wouldn&apos;t mind some &apos;destabilization&apos; of science,</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="36" relname="condition">
if done in the &apos;right&apos; way.</segment>

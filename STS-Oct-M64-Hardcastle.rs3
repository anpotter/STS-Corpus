&amp;gt;I, for one, am still puzzled by methodological relativism.  The point
&amp;gt;seems to be: If writing a history of an episode in science, do not
&amp;gt;presume the outcome in the history.  Or, more narrowly, evaluate each
&amp;gt;phase of the episode only on the information available to the
&amp;gt;participants at that phase.

&amp;gt;Sounds utterly uncontroversial -- it is not so much anti-Whig as I
&amp;gt;commitment to viewing scientists as not blessed with precognition.
&amp;gt;
&amp;gt;The question is, again, the very one raised by Schmaus -- who doesn&apos;t do
&amp;gt;history this way?</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="27" relname="span">

reminded me of one case, at least,</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="18" relname="span"> where the explanation of a scientist&apos;s
behavior was made to rely upon information that was not had by that
scientist,</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="4" relname="elaboration"> nor could have been had by him unless things were drastically
different. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="21" relname="span"> Mary Hesse (1973), for example, explains Maxwell&apos;s belief in
the displacement current by reference to the fact that it rendered his
equations Lorentz-invariant, pace Maxwell&apos;s own &quot;relatively unconvincing
reasons&quot; which involved, on Hesse&apos;s account, a &quot;superficial analogy with
magnetism&quot; and a &quot;dubious mechanical model of the ether&quot; (138). </segment>

          It may not always be improper to &apos;explain&apos; a scientist&apos;s
apparently baseless
          intuition by such mathematical truths..., particularly if our
later knowledge
          of them enables us to interpret hints in Maxwell that could not
have been

intelligible to his contemporaries.  (138)</segment>

This is one example,</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="22" relname="span"> and Hesse may count as a philosopher, not an
historian, in many books,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="10" relname="nonvolitional-result"> so perhaps it is just barely an answer to
Richardson&apos;s challenge.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="25" relname="span">  Still, I&apos;m curious if historians who know Maxwell
and the displacement current better than I aren&apos;t attracted by Hesse&apos;s
strategy, if only slightly.</segment>

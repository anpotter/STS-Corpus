    <segment id="1" parent="69" relname="preparation">
Response to the strategies proposed for dealing with backlash. </segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="3" relname="concession">

I think HAKKEN&apos;s participatory design research is an ideal site for 
STSers to engage in the reconstruction of scientific practices,</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="45" relname="span"> but I&apos;m 
not sure that everyone else&apos;s research arena lends itself to such strong 
possibilities for intervention.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="5" relname="concession"> &apos;Diversity&apos; of points of intervention is 
the key word here, as TRAWEEK and LYNCH have emphasized. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="44" relname="span">

However, contra TRAWEEK, I&apos;m not so sure that much would be gained by 
trying to fend off -- in meticuluous detail -- all the misreadings that 
critics have made of STS work.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="46" relname="span"> In the first place, many of these 
misreadings have been made in the context of scientists trying to show that 
STSers have misread the science they are writing about.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="restatement"> In other words, 
their misreading results from what they perceive as our misreading.</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="47" relname="span"> Shall 
we just continue like this -- in hermeneutical tit-for-tat? </segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="elaboration">And to what 
end? </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="11" relname="condition">(Perhaps a Machiavellian will suggest that if the battle is kept at 
the level of hermeneutics,</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="50" relname="span"> then powerful people will think this is just a 
bunch of academic squabbling, </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="11" relname="elaboration">and the STS community will be saved for 
one more day!)</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="58" relname="span">

The second issue is what would be the forum for all this hermeneutical
correction?</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="54" relname="span"> Some of you who follow the various backlashes against feminism
will know the amount of critical ink that has been spilled on trying to
correct the errors contained Christina Hoff Sommers&apos; _Who Stole Feminism?_</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="14" relname="interpretation">
This is a truly minor-league work that nevertheless has greatly exercised 
many of the best feminist thinkers, who have gone through the trouble of 
refuting the book chapter and verse.</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="55" relname="span"> But where have they done this? </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="18" relname="concession"> I 
may be corrected on this point,</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="52" relname="span"> but all of these refutations have so far
occurred in the pages of left-wing publications.</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="57" relname="span"> More preaching to the 
converted, I&apos;m afraid.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="21" relname="condition"> If this book by Sommers is such a menace,</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="56" relname="span"> why 
doesn&apos;t somebody on the left bother to write a reasoned critique in a 
RIGHT-wing publication?  </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="62" relname="span">

One thing that doesn&apos;t seem to have been mentioned in dealing with the
backlash is the possibility of STSers publicly diagnosing why the backlash
occurs NOW --</segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="22" relname="circumstance"> despite the fact that STSers have been saying the things
they have for the last quarter-century.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="63" relname="span"> A big part of the art of spin
doctoring is controling the frame of reference within which the audience
understands a debate.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="59" relname="span"> This is the sort of thing that conservatives are
very good at doing</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="25" relname="evidence"> (as measured by how even centre-left newspapers will
adopt conservative framings of the issues).</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="60" relname="span"> If STSers were to move away
from worrying about how their particular texts are misunderstood, and look
at the larger framing devices that critics use to situate STS,</segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="61" relname="span"> then we
might have something that would trade well in a public forum. </segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="67" relname="span">

For example, I&apos;ve been surprised at how many journalists have made it 
look as though STS is itself a backlash to threats that conservatives 
have posed to the social scientists and humanities in the last decade or 
so.</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="66" relname="span"> I would have thought that here we should be highlighting the 
institutional instability of the natural science community -- threatened 
as it by unmanageable budgets, disappointed public expectations, well 
publicized frauds, not to mention privatization.</segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="32" relname="circumstance"> In such an uncertain 
environment, where we clearly stand at a crossroads with regard to the 
future of science policy,</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="64" relname="span"> STS gains a certain prominence that it had 
previously lacked.</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="65" relname="span"> Not surprisingly, scientists are uneasy and their 
critiques express that</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="33" relname="elaboration"> (e.g. claims that STSers are deterring students 
from entering science careers and the nation&apos;s fate is hanging in the 
balance). </segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="36" relname="preparation">

Finally, in response to HESS,</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="74" relname="span"> I just don&apos;t think we&apos;re going to avoid the 
business of polarizing sides to this issue.</segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="72" relname="conjunction"> The media clearly operates this 
way,</segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="72" relname="conjunction"> and people drop into this mode of thought quite easily.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="40" relname="nonvolitional-cause"> What often 
passes as a more nuanced or complex view usually ends up becoming the 
basis for shifting the terms of the polarization:</segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="70" relname="span"> so that &apos;STSers v. 
scientists&apos; may become &apos;ascending vs. declining disciplines&apos; or &apos;poorer 
vs. richer fields&apos;, etc.</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="71" relname="span"> But even if shifting the poles is the best we 
can hope for,</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="73" relname="span"> that may not be such a bad thing.</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="75" relname="span"> What I think is more 
worrisome is the tendency for some to see how the issue gets quickly 
polarized, and then decide that the matter has become far too &apos;vulgar&apos; 
for them to waste intellectual energy.</segment>

&amp;gt; Response to MORMAN and FROST:
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; I agree that _Telling the Truth..._ is a good ideological resource for STS
&amp;gt; fending off the attacks of scientists, since it shows how many of the
&amp;gt; constructivist critiques of science (and its history) make sense, even
&amp;gt; within an Enlightenment framework of &apos;the truth will set you free.&apos;
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; However, matters aren&apos;t so cut-and-dry because Appleby, Hunt &amp; Jacob (AHJ)
&amp;gt; don&apos;t see themselves as mere ideological resources. They actually believe
&amp;gt; in the Enlightenment project, and, between the lines, you can see that
&amp;gt; they&apos;re none too pleased about the cultural consequences of an unrepentant
&amp;gt; relativism. [...] By the
&amp;gt; end of the book, it becomes clear that they see this devaluation of the
&amp;gt; consequences of inquiry to be just as bad as placing political
&amp;gt; restrictions on inquiry. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; My guess is that FROST&apos;s synthesis of AHJ and the radical core of science 
&amp;gt; studies is not going to be very easy because it would first require that 
&amp;gt; the people on &apos;our&apos; side take more seriously the political consequences of 
&amp;gt; their epistemological commitments.

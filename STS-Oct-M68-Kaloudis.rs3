&amp;gt;Yet the overall impression one would have is that 
&amp;gt;STS inquiry is a form of &quot;critique,&quot; that is, for the most part, there is 
&amp;gt;very little in the way of a positive program to account for the place of 
&amp;gt;science in relation to other institutions/practices or 
&amp;gt;to change science/practice of science/etc. to be something different.  
&amp;gt;In a world dominated by a rather simple-minded and falsifying view of 
&amp;gt;science, there was a good deal of virtue in such critique.  But at this 
&amp;gt;point, one begins to ask: 1) what is the positive analytical program? 2) 
&amp;gt;what kinds of changes do STS practitioners envision, and are 
&amp;gt;they in the self-understanding of scientists? the public understanding of 
&amp;gt;science? the control of scientific institutions? 3) where do STS 
practitioners see change taking place: in the classroom? in 
&amp;gt;the press?  in the Congress?  on the streets?</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="21" relname="span">

STS inquiry, I believe, tought us that it is not possible to separate the 
contextual aspects of science from its content.</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="22" relname="span"> The big challenge in STS was 
until now to understand how previously believed irrelevant elements do shape 
the direction and the very content of scientific inquiry.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="19" relname="span"> Likewise, I wonder 
if we should start seriously to consider the epistemological consequences of 
the discourse of public understanding of science.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="16" relname="list"> Is it so sure that PuS is 
more made for the public than for science itself? </segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="16" relname="list">

What if one claims that PuS helps science to be &apos;scientific&apos;?</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="16" relname="list"> What would be 
the implications of such a claim?</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="16" relname="list"> Would&apos;nt that open for a reconsideration 
of PuS &apos;s implications for society and science alike?</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="16" relname="list"> Would&apos;nt that open for 
a reconsideration of the ideological aspects of scientific discourse. </segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="16" relname="list">
Would&apos;nt that force us to rethink how the &apos;reality&apos; of science is stabilised 
and secured?</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="16" relname="list"> And at last but not least, would&apos;nt that compell us to rethink 
the nature of the discourse in social sciences and the political structures  
based on this discourse? </segment>

Not many of these questions are new and unknown to STS field (or to social 
sciences for that matter).</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="17" relname="span"> The question is, however, whether we should 
seriously start to think about PuS as a component of science equally 
important as science&apos;s financial sources or its laboratories and study the 
implications of this fact to our understanding of science and society alike.</segment>

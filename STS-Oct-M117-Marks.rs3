    <segment id="1" parent="64" relname="motivation">        Steve Fuller, Merry Maisel and others suggest that those of us
who ask pointed questions come out of the closet with some of their own 
answers/opinions,arguments. </segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="3" relname="preparation"> Fair enough:</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="64" relname="span"> as one of the self-accused, let 
me sketch out some articulations and reflections.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="107" relname="span">

        Marks&apos; practice. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="82" relname="span"> For eight years or so, I&apos;ve been trying to 
write a historical account of how statistical methods and expertise 
entered into clinical medicine in the post-World War II period. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="5" relname="elaboration">  A crude caricature of the thesis is that I argue that randomized 
experiments are a kind of social engineering which ultimately won&apos;t do 
the job of making social decisions about the appropriateness of medical 
care, medical technologies, etc.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="68" relname="span">  My practical goals for this book are
relatively modest</segment>
    <segment id="66" parent="7" relname="concession"> (I think):</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="67" relname="list"> to get some 
medical practitioners to reflect a little more about their ideas about 
evidence, methodology, and clinical decision-making,</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="67" relname="list"> and to get some 
statistical practitioners to do the same. </segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="81" relname="span"> 

        Along the way, I participate 
in some seminars with statisticians and physicians, and ask questions 
about why they choose the kinds of models they do to analyze data, why 
they ask the kind of research questions they do, and argue with them 
about the scientific, methodological and political assumptions of what 
they do.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="71" relname="span">  I do this, I suppose, for several reasons:</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="70" relname="list"> like Gale (and 
Traweek?), I am truly fascinated by the science here, and enjoy thinking 
about it;</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="70" relname="list"> like Edwards and others, I think that this community is 
generally extremely insular--in Fuller&apos;s sense--</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="70" relname="elaboration">they operate in a 
community where until recently (recently for a historian) no one has ever 
questioned much less challenged what it is they do, and that it is 
worthwhile to be an outsider in the community, bringing in metholodigcal, 
political and social perspectives 
and questions which they might not choose to ask.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="74" relname="span">  Occasionally, I even 
do the kind of thing van Meulen proposes and which worries Steve Fuller: </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="73" relname="span">
giving them advice on how to better present their case in non-academic 
forums.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="16" relname="elaboration">  So, for example, these people strongly believe that the pressure 
from Congress to include in clinical trials groups which have been--it is 
said--traditionally underrepresented--is pressure premised on a 
misunderstanding of the nature and magnitude of sub-group differences in 
clinical trials. </segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="75" relname="concession"> I have been telling them for about a year that they may 
be right analytically,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="20" relname="unless"> but unless they make their case clearly and 
effectively outside the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine, </segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="75" relname="span">
they will have little effect on the public debate.</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="79" relname="span">
        Now, with the exception, possibly, of this last example, I don&apos;t 
see any of this activity as any different than what I do in the 
classroom:</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="78" relname="span"> asking questions about assumptions, goals, evidence, and 
social relations. </segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="24" relname="concession"> I&apos;m personally pretty comfortable with this--more 
comfortable than I am going door to door to raise money for the 
Chesapeake Bay fund or solicit votes for a referendum on toxic waste--and 
certainly much more comfortable than I ever was in demonstrations or 
public meetings. </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="77" relname="span"> But I don&apos;t overestimate the political import of this 
activity--</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="24" relname="elaboration">I don&apos;t even, by and large, confuse it with politics, which one 
of my teachers once described as &quot;the mobilization of bias&quot;. </segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="106" relname="span"> It seems to 
me that there are some differences between education and politics which 
get overlooked in some of these discussions.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="28" relname="concession">
        1) To take my statistical arena, I think I have some credibility 
in a small community of practitioners, in the sense that what I say gets 
listened to, and argued with. </segment>
    <segment id="28" parent="86" relname="span"> But statistical reasoning and a social 
engineering approach to the world is deep in the bones of these people 
who, are, moreover, as physicians deeply practical individuals who care 
far less about critique than about doing and fixing. </segment>
    <segment id="29" parent="30" relname="unless"> So, unless there 
are practical consequences to my questions/doubts,</segment>
    <segment id="30" parent="84" relname="span"> they rarely serve as 
more than light entertainment. </segment>
    <segment id="31" parent="32" relname="concession"> Which is, I think, as it should be.</segment>
    <segment id="32" parent="85" relname="span"> But 
the implication of this for the practitioner of science studies is that 
unless one is willing to take an activist stance to change certain kinds 
of statistical practices/institutional forms of expert evaluation, and 
seek allies outside the academy in this effort,</segment>
    <segment id="33" parent="32" relname="elaboration"> one&apos;s efforts are bound 
to be of limited effect.</segment>
    <segment id="34" parent="83" relname="span">  The argument is not that people don&apos;t change 
their ideas--</segment>
    <segment id="35" parent="34" relname="elaboration">many of the heterodox ideas about statistical inference and 
clinical categories I was pushing ten years ago are now 
&quot;respectable&quot;--</segment>
    <segment id="36" parent="87" relname="span">but that the sources of change have little to do with one 
outsider who occasionally has conversations with practitioners.  </segment>
    <segment id="37" parent="90" relname="span">
        2) For those people who think that education [about science]  alone is the 
way to 
go to transform the place of science in society, I suggest they take a 
look at the &quot;Worm in the Core,&quot; an account of the general science 
curriculum reforms at Harvard in the 1950s, which produced the case 
studies in the history of science. </segment>
    <segment id="38" parent="37" relname="elaboration"> The analysis, by Peter Buck and 
Barbara Rosenkrantz, published in a collection called Tradition and 
Transformation in the Sciences [Transformation &amp; Tradition?] edited by 
Everett Mendelsohn, shows how difficult it is to implement a program of 
cultural and political change armed only with the weapons of curricular 
reform.</segment>
    <segment id="39" parent="40" relname="preparation">
        3) On the politics of science. </segment>
    <segment id="40" parent="92" relname="span"> From various sources over the 
past 25 years, we have been learning the lesson that many situations 
involve/construct power:</segment>
    <segment id="41" parent="91" relname="list"> the classroom,</segment>
    <segment id="42" parent="91" relname="list"> the laboratory,</segment>
    <segment id="43" parent="91" relname="list"> the housework and 
childcare,</segment>
    <segment id="44" parent="91" relname="list"> the seminar,</segment>
    <segment id="45" parent="91" relname="list"> etc.</segment>
    <segment id="46" parent="93" relname="span">  This has been probably the most important 
intellectual and practical accomplishment in what the French like to call 
the human sciences.</segment>
    <segment id="47" parent="46" relname="nonvolitional-cause">  When applied to science studies, it has been 
extremely feccund and generative.</segment>
    <segment id="48" parent="101" relname="span">  BUT there is a kind of danger in
recognizing the widespread distribution/sources of power--that it 
encourages a confusion about the relative amounts of power.</segment>
    <segment id="49" parent="95" relname="span">  I don&apos;t believe 
that 
there is a single scientist/laboratory group/pick your unit which has the 
power of a Rush Limbaugh or a Saddam Hussein or, for that matter, a Bill 
Clinton.</segment>
    <segment id="50" parent="97" relname="span">  Their &quot;levers&quot;--to invoke Latour--are bigger and they are loaded
with something more powerful than a scientific paper or a 
deconstructionist argument.</segment>
    <segment id="51" parent="96" relname="list">  For one thing, they are loaded with 
emotions, and the skill to use them, which is something most of us
have either foresworn to use, or are nowhere near as good at using as 
these folks.</segment>
    <segment id="52" parent="96" relname="list">  For another, they have more followers.</segment>
    <segment id="53" parent="96" relname="list"> [ And, in many cases, a 
monopoly on weapons in the territory they control.] </segment>
    <segment id="54" parent="98" relname="antithesis"> I just don&apos;t 
believe that any scientist is powerful in this degree:</segment>
    <segment id="55" parent="98" relname="span"> in fact, I find 
most scientists to be rather powerless</segment>
    <segment id="56" parent="55" relname="circumstance"> once they take a few steps into 
the political arena.   </segment>
    <segment id="57" parent="103" relname="span">
        4) Where all this takes me in light of the past few weeks of 
discussion about STS is to observe that the only allies people in STS 
seem to be talking about enlisting are scientists: </segment>
    <segment id="58" parent="102" relname="list">
scientist-colleagues,</segment>
    <segment id="59" parent="102" relname="list"> dissident scientists,</segment>
    <segment id="60" parent="102" relname="list"> scientists in training,</segment>
    <segment id="61" parent="102" relname="list"> etc. </segment>
    <segment id="62" parent="104" relname="span"> 
That seems to me a rather insular approach,</segment>
    <segment id="63" parent="62" relname="condition"> if one&apos;s goals are political 
or social change.</segment>

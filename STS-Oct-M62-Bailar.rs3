    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="circumstance">Some six months ago I sent a short message trying to get some 
of you readers to understand how scientists tend to look at STS 
and related matters.</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="28" relname="span">  I got a few civil but modestly unfriendly 
replies</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="2" relname="background"> (at least, I took them that way),</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="29" relname="span"> and dropped the 
matter. </segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="36" relname="span"> Recent mail suggests that there may be a lot more to 
be said. </segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="30" relname="span"> The point at immediate issue is what scientists (an 
impossibly broad and vague term) _think_ about STS,</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="6" relname="antithesis"> not what 
is the truth (even more impossibly broad and vague).</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="34" relname="span">

&amp;gt;From their point of view, right or wrong in degrees we do not
need to analyse now, STSers are a bunch of arrogant upstarts,
willing to tell everyone else what to think and do</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="8" relname="elaboration"> -- all
despite the everage STSer&apos;s lack of any intimate, firsthand
understanding of what science is all about and how it
progresses.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="31" relname="list">  How many of &quot;us&quot; have solid records of productive
accomplishment in research? </segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="31" relname="list"> How many have ever gone out on a
limb with a new theory that could be disproved by a single
critical experiment?</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="31" relname="list"> How many have been responsible for
building and administering (and funding) a large and complex
cooperative enterprise such as a busy lab? </segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="31" relname="list"> How many have
tried to solve &quot;real&quot; problems of, say, agricultural
production, or lethal disease, or homelessness, or energy
production/conservation, or ....... ? </segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="31" relname="list"> How many have ever had
the joy of discovering a new and important fact (which I will
not at this place define) about the physical world? </segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="32" relname="span"> In short,
what makes &quot;us&quot; so smart about something we don&apos;t really
understand from the inside,</segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="15" relname="elaboration"> and why should we the &quot;real&quot;
scientists pay any attention to you, or make it easy for
others to do so? </segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="32" relname="elaboration"> Are we, the STSers, going to make the world a 
better place, in any way that matters very much?</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="19" relname="concession">

There seem to be sound answers to the skeptics,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="38" relname="span"> but we are not 
going to get very far by complaining that &quot;We don&apos;t get no
respect&quot;, or by assuming that the working scientist will be
convinced if we just yell at him/her loudly enough and long
enough.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="39" relname="span">

What we need now is more thoughtful discussion (and even
agreement?) among ourselves about what we are really trying to
accomplish</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="20" relname="elaboration"> -- something that goes beyond the mere
understanding of science/scientists and considers the uses of
such understanding -- </segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="20" relname="elaboration">and then about how we can and should try
to attain whatever goals we have set for ourselves. </segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="40" relname="span"> I do not
believe that we really prefer the somewhat mean-spirited fun
of being a bunch of fractious kibitzers, full of gossipy 
conversation in the form of professional communication but 
having little impact. </segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="23" relname="elaboration"> (&quot;WOW!  Look what I&apos;ve discovered about 
that area of science that was hot a decade ago!&quot;)</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="26" relname="concession">

The language above is stronger than I would use,</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="42" relname="span"> but I so not
mean it to express my own views.</segment>
    <segment id="27" parent="42" relname="purpose">  It is meant to convey the
spirit of what I have heard from colleagues who are a bit 
unsympathetic about STS.</segment>

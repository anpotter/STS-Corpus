    <segment id="1" parent="2" relname="circumstance">
When I was teaching at Cornell,</segment>
    <segment id="2" parent="31" relname="span"> I once drove from Ithaca to Boston with an
undergraduate engineering student.</segment>
    <segment id="3" parent="27" relname="span"> He told me that in a required
introductory course, his entire class had been assigned to build a device
for assisting handicapped people to get into and out of cars.</segment>
    <segment id="4" parent="3" relname="elaboration"> The only
constraints were that the device be simple, fairly inexpensive to
construct, and entirely mechanical in nature (i.e., no electric
components).</segment>
    <segment id="5" parent="27" relname="evaluation">

I found this an ingenious and intriguing assignment, and said so.</segment>
    <segment id="6" parent="30" relname="span"> He then
told me that he and everyone he knew hated it.</segment>
    <segment id="7" parent="29" relname="sequence"> They wanted to build cool
machines with lots of motors and computer controllers,</segment>
    <segment id="8" parent="29" relname="sequence"> and as long as they
could work with what they thought of as cutting-edge components,</segment>
    <segment id="9" parent="29" relname="sequence"> they
didn&apos;t care much about the thing&apos;s purpose.</segment>
    <segment id="10" parent="29" relname="sequence"> In fact, they&apos;d prefer to think
up purposes themselves.</segment>
    <segment id="11" parent="45" relname="span">

This parable points me (at least) toward two of the goals of STS in
education.</segment>
    <segment id="12" parent="33" relname="list"> First is helping people who&apos;ve come under the seductive power of
techno-wizardry to see, comprehend, and care about what sorts of problems
really need to be solved.</segment>
    <segment id="13" parent="43" relname="span"> Second is teaching how people actually interact
with and use designed products, which involves teaching certain social
values, such as the appropriate-technology goal of making devices as
simple, cheap, energy-efficient, and user-transparent as practically
possible.</segment>
    <segment id="14" parent="15" relname="concession"> The engineering professor who made up that assignment may have
had the same goal,</segment>
    <segment id="15" parent="34" relname="span"> but it certainly isn&apos;t common.  </segment>
    <segment id="16" parent="17" relname="concession">

In a way this is simply a plea for a broad, balanced approach to
techno-science education.</segment>
    <segment id="17" parent="41" relname="span"> In another way, it&apos;s more profound than that.</segment>
    <segment id="18" parent="36" relname="span"> My
Silicon Valley-based engineering students assume that the problems they&apos;ll
work to solve will be posed for them by the marketplace,</segment>
    <segment id="19" parent="18" relname="means"> via the companies
they work for.</segment>
    <segment id="20" parent="35" relname="sequence"> They want to invent cool stuff</segment>
    <segment id="21" parent="35" relname="sequence"> and then see if they can sell
it.</segment>
    <segment id="22" parent="38" relname="span"> The idea of interacting with potential users, especially in any kind of
thorough or systematic way, doesn&apos;t get much press in their world since
it&apos;s assumed to be perfectly mediated by the market. </segment>
    <segment id="23" parent="39" relname="span">

In the Computer Science Dept. here, Terry Winograd has started a program in
Human-Computer Interaction.</segment>
    <segment id="24" parent="23" relname="elaboration"> Its focus is on developing and teaching methods
of software design which include potential users in the design process from
the beginning.</segment>
    <segment id="25" parent="26" relname="concession">  This is one big step toward a more complete approach to
engineering,</segment>
    <segment id="26" parent="40" relname="span"> but the other -- which really requires STS types -- lies in
helping engineers understand themselves as _social_ engineers and seeing
how important that is.</segment>
